# Legacy Feature Sets

This directory contains pre-V2 feature configurations for historical reference.

## Contents

- `v1_baseline.yaml` - Original baseline features (adjusted EPA/SR)
- `adjusted_v1.yaml` - Adjusted features variant

## Status

These configs are **archived** and should not be used for V2 workflow.

For V2 feature sets, create new configs in `conf/features/` following V2 naming:

- `minimal_unadjusted_v1.yaml` - Phase 1 baseline
- `opponent_adjusted_v1.yaml` - Phase 2 candidate
- etc.

See [`docs/project_org/feature_registry.md`](../../../docs/project_org/feature_registry.md) for active V2 feature sets.
