# Legacy Experiments

This directory contains pre-V2 experiment configurations for historical reference.

## Contents

- `01_train_baseline.yaml` - Original baseline training (pre-V2)
- `02_test_adjusted_features.yaml` - Adjusted feature testing (pre-V2)

## Status

These configs are **archived** and should not be used for V2 workflow.

For V2 experiments, create new configs in `conf/experiment/` following the V2 naming convention:

- `v2-001_baseline.yaml`
- `v2-002_feature_name.yaml`
- etc.
