# @package _global_

defaults:
  - override /hydra: default
  - override /model: linear      # Use the baseline model
  - override /features: adjusted_v1 # Use the new, expanded feature set

# This experiment tests the hypothesis that adding more adjusted features
# improves the performance of the simple baseline model.

# The results of this run should be compared directly to the 'train_baseline' run.
# If performance improves, 'adjusted_v1' is a candidate for the new benchmark feature set.

# To run:
# PYTHONPATH=. uv run python src/train.py experiment=02_test_adjusted_features

core:
  experiment_name: "test_adjusted_features_v1"
  tags: ["features", "v1"]

# No changes to model or feature defaults are needed for this run.
