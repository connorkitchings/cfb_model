# AI Development Session Templates

This document provides **copy-paste templates** for starting and ending an AI-assisted development
session. Each template ensures the assistant gathers the right context, operates within project
standards, and records its work correctly.

## ðŸŸ¢ Session Kickoff Prompt

This is a template prompt to start a new AI session for the cfb_model project. Copy, paste, and fill
in the bracketed information to bring the AI up to speed quickly.

Hello. We are continuing our work on the 'cfb_model' project. Your role is my AI co-pilot, and we
will be following the Vibe Coding System.

To get up to speed, please perform the following steps:

1. **Load the Minimal Context Pack (token-efficient):**
    - `docs/project_org/project_charter.md` â€” Charter, scope, and standards.
    - `docs/planning/roadmap.md` â€” Current sprint goal, tasks, and acceptance criteria.
    - `docs/decisions/decision_log.md` â€” Planning-level decisions made so far.
    - `docs/project_org/modeling_baseline.md` â€” MVP modeling approach and betting policy.
    - `docs/operations/weekly_pipeline.md` â€” Manual weekly runbook and outputs.
    - Optional quick refs: `docs/index.md`, `README.md`, `pyproject.toml` (only if needed).
    - Keep context small: skim headings and bullet summaries; capture 6â€“10 concise bullets.

2. **Confirm the Sprint Focus:**
    - From `docs/planning/roadmap.md`, extract the sprint goal and top 3 active tasks.
    - Note acceptance criteria relevant to today's objective.

3. **Quick Health Check (fast, optional):**
    - `uv run ruff check .` â€” ensure linter is clean or note issues to fix.
    - `uv run pytest -q` â€” run unit tests (synthetic tests exist; no external data needed).
    - `uv run mkdocs build --strict` â€” catch doc reference issues if docs are in scope.

3. **Review the Last Session's Handoff:**
    - Search `/session_logs/` for all `.md` files matching today's date (e.g., `2025-08-03.md`,
      `2025-08-03_02.md`, etc.).
    - Review the most recent session log entry to understand exactly where we left off, focusing on
      the 'Session Handoff' section.
    - If there are multiple logs for today, always use the highest-numbered log (e.g., `_02`, `_03`
      etc.) as the most recent handoff.
    - If no log exists for today, check the latest `.md` file with the most recent date.

4. **Prepare for Today's Task:**
    - **Our focus today is:** `[Describe the concrete task to execute this session]`
    - Note: Data paths resolve via `CFB_MODEL_DATA_ROOT` or default `./data` (see `src/cfb_model/config.py`).
    - Prefect flows available: `preaggregations_flow(year, data_root=None, verbose=True)` in `cfb_model.flows.preaggregations`.

Once you have completed this review, please confirm you are ready, and we will begin.

## ðŸ”´ Session Closing Prompt

This is a template prompt to end a development session cleanly. Copy, paste, and fill in the
bracketed information.

We are now ending our development session for today. To ensure we maintain our project context and
prepare for a smooth handoff, please perform the following wrap-up tasks:

1. **Summarize Session Accomplishments:**
    - **Task Completed:** `[IMPL-task:ID] - [Brief description of the task]`
    - **Key Outcomes:** `[List the 1-3 main achievements of the session, e.g., 'Successfully
      connected to the CollegeFootballData API to ingest play-by-play data.']`

2. **Identify Blockers and Learnings:**
    - **Blockers Encountered:** `[Describe any issues that are preventing progress, e.g., 'The API
      is rate-limiting our requests.']`
    - **New Learnings/Patterns:** `[Mention any new solutions or patterns discovered that should be
      added to the knowledge_base.md, e.g., 'Found a more efficient way to parse JSON responses.']`

3. **Define Next Steps:**
    - **Immediate Next Task:** `[What is the very next thing to do? e.g., 'Refactor the data
      ingestion pipeline to handle rate-limiting.']`

4. **Final Health Check:**
    - Run `uv run ruff check .` and `uv run ruff format .` to ensure code quality
    - Run `uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short` to verify all tests pass
    - Run `uv run mkdocs build --quiet` to verify documentation builds correctly
    - Include health check results in the dev log

5. **Generate the Dev Log:**
    - Based on the information above, please generate a complete dev log entry for today.
    - Use the template from `session_logs/_template.md`.
    - **Important:** Create a new directory for today's date `[YYYY-MM-DD]` inside `/session_logs/`
      if it doesn't exist.

- Create the new log with a sequential, zero-padded filename (e.g., `01.md`, `02.md`) inside the
    date directory.

6. **Update Documentation:**
    - Review `README.md`,`docs/index.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `docs/decisions/README.md`,
      `mkdocs.yml`, `docs/project_org/project_charter.md`, and `docs/project_org/kb_overview.md`.
    - Also review `docs/guides/ai_session_templates.md` if workflow guidance changed (e.g., new flows, health checks).
    - Update any relevant documentation based on the changes made during the session.

After you have generated the dev log, I will review it and make any final edits. All version control
(committing, pushing, etc.) is handled manually and outside the AI workflow.

### Usage Tips

- **Automate**: You can store these snippets in your editor snippets for one-click insertion.
- **Enforce Links**: Always use the linking syntax to keep logs and docs interconnected.
- **Be Concise**: Logs should capture *decisions and results*, not every keystroke.
- **Review Checklist**: Before ending, run `pre-commit run --all-files` to catch linting issues.
- **Manual Version Control**: All actions related to git (committing, pushing, branching, etc.)
  must be performed manually by the user. The AI will never perform these actions or prompt you to
  do so automatically.

By following these templates, each AI development session starts with the right context and ends
with a clean, traceable recordâ€”ensuring continuity and accountability across the project.
