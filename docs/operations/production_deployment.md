## Deployment Architecture Options

### Option A: Publisher Model (Local Execution + Email) - ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED

This model addresses the constraint of data living on a local external hard drive by avoiding the need for a constantly accessible web server. The pipeline runs locally and pushes the results to the user.

**Architecture**:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Local Machine] --> B(Run Weekly Pipeline)
    B --> C[Generate Picks CSV]
    C --> D(Run Publisher Script)
    D -- Formatted Email --> E[User's Inbox]
    F[CFBD API] --> B
```

**Components**:
- **Data Processing**: Local machine with external drive storage, executed via `scripts/cli.py`.
- **Output**: Standard `_bets.csv` report.
- **Publishing**: A new script (`scripts/publish_picks.py`) formats the CSV into a clean HTML table and emails it to a configured address.

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ **Maximum Security**: No inbound network connections are required. Your local machine is never exposed to the internet.
- ‚úÖ **High Reliability**: Once the report is emailed, it's accessible from any device (phone, laptop) without depending on the local machine being online.
- ‚úÖ **Simplicity & Low Cost**: Very easy to implement and maintain using standard Python libraries. No hosting costs.
- ‚úÖ **Data Privacy**: All data and models remain on your local machine. Only the final report is sent.

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå **Not Interactive**: The output is a static report. There are no live dashboards or controls.
- ‚ùå **Requires Email Configuration**: User must configure SMTP credentials (e.g., a Gmail App Password) in a local `.env` file.

**Estimated Setup Time**: <1 day
**Monthly Cost**: $0

### Option B: Full Cloud Migration

**Architecture**:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[AWS/GCP Cloud Function] --> B[Data Processing Pipeline]
    B --> C[Cloud Storage S3/GCS]
    C --> D[Generated Picks CSV]
    D --> E[Streamlit/FastAPI App]
    E --> F[Users via Web Browser]
    G[CFBD API] --> B
    H[CloudWatch/Monitoring] --> B
    I[Scheduler] --> A
```

**Components**:
- **Data Processing**: AWS Lambda/Google Cloud Functions
- **Storage**: S3/Google Cloud Storage
- **Web Interface**: Streamlit on cloud or custom FastAPI

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Fully automated pipeline, high reliability, and built-in monitoring.

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå High complexity, significant hosting costs ($50-200/month), and vendor lock-in.

### Option C: Semi-Automated Local Server

**Architecture**:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Local Scheduler] --> B[Data Processing Pipeline]
    B --> C[Local CSV + Backup]
    C --> D[Generated Picks CSV]
    D --> E[Local Streamlit Server]
    E --> F[Users via VPN/Port Forwarding]
    G[CFBD API] --> B
```

**Components**:
- **Data Processing**: Local machine with `cron`.
- **Web Interface**: Local Streamlit server.
- **Access**: Port forwarding or VPN.

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Automated pipeline execution with lower costs than full cloud.

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå **Security Risk**: Port forwarding is a significant security concern.
- ‚ùå **High Maintenance**: Depends on home network stability and requires manual network configuration.

## Decision & Recommendation

Given the core constraint that data resides on a local external hard drive, **Option A: Publisher Model** is the clear and recommended path forward. It is the most secure, reliable, and simple solution that perfectly fits the project's operational reality.

The original recommendation of a hybrid Streamlit Cloud app is no longer viable due to the inability of the cloud service to reliably access the local data source.
