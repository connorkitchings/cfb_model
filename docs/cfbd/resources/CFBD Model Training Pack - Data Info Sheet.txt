College Football Model Pack: Data Info Sheet

This dataset includes cleaned, opponent-adjusted college football data for FBS games from Week 5 through postseason, covering the 2016-2024 seasons. Each row represents a single game, with team statistics based on games played prior to that matchup only, ensuring no leakage of future results.
The dataset is ideal for training machine learning models to predict outcomes like:

Final score or score margin Win probability
Spread cover probability Offensive or defensive efficiency
Fields with the word	represent opponent-adjusted metrics, calculated to account for schedule strength up to the point of the game.


Dataset Size and Features

Each row includes 92 total columns, consisting of:

81 usable features for training predictive models
11 contextual fields such as game ID, team names, conferences, and outcome labels (e.g. final team points, margin)

The dataset has been structured to separate features from targets and identifiers, making it easy to plug into model pipelines with minimal preprocessing.
