# V2 Baseline Model (Ridge Regression)

**Status**: Phase 1 — Baseline Establishment  
**Model**: Ridge Regression (sklearn)  
**Features**: Minimal Unadjusted EPA/SR  
**Philosophy**: Start simple, validate V2 workflow  
**Date Established**: TBD (2025-12-XX)

---

## Overview

The **V2 Baseline** is the foundation of the new experimentation workflow. It is intentionally simple, fast, and reproducible, serving as the benchmark against which all future improvements are measured.

> **Note**: This represents a complete reset from legacy models (CatBoost/XGBoost v5). Legacy models are archived; V2 starts from scratch with rigor-first philosophy.

---

## Objective

1. **Establish Benchmark**: Create a simple, interpretable baseline model
2. **Validate Workflow**: Prove the V2 4-phase workflow (Baseline → Features → Models → Deployment)
3. **Define Floor**: Set minimum acceptable performance before adding complexity

---

## Model Architecture

### Algorithm

**Ridge Regression** (`sklearn.linear_model.Ridge`)

**Rationale**:

- **Interpretable**: Linear coefficients are explainable
- **Fast**: Trains in seconds, no hyperparameter tuning needed
- **Stable**: Regularization prevents overfitting
- **Baseline-appropriate**: Simple enough to measure feature/model improvements clearly

**Hyperparameters**:

- `alpha=1.0` (L2 regularization strength, fixed for baseline)

---

## Features

### Phase 1: Minimal Unadjusted Set

**Philosophy**: Start from **raw, unadjusted** statistics to establish absolute floor performance.

**Feature Set**: `minimal_unadjusted_v1`

**Features** (4 total):

```python
home_off_epa_pp       # Home team offensive EPA per play (season-to-date)
home_def_epa_pp       # Home team defensive EPA per play (season-to-date)
away_off_epa_pp       # Away team offensive EPA per play (season-to-date)
away_def_epa_pp       # Away team defensive EPA per play (season-to-date)
```

**Data Source**: `processed/team_season/year=YYYY/team=XXX/side=offense|defense/*.csv`

**Rationale**:

- EPA (Expected Points Added) is the most predictive single metric in CFB
- Season-to-date aggregation is simple and transparent
- No opponent adjustment — this establishes the baseline before proving adjustment helps
- No recency weighting — uniform weighting of all games
- No special teams, tempo, or advanced features — added in Phase 2 if they improve performance

---

## Targets

**Spread Prediction** (Primary):

```python
spread_target = home_final_points - away_final_points
```

**Total Prediction** (Optional):

```python
total_target = home_final_points + away_final_points
```

## Training Protocol

### Data Split

| Year(s)         | Purpose        | Usage                                        |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 2019, 2021-2023 | Training       | Fit Ridge regression                         |
| 2024            | Test (Holdout) | Evaluate performance, never used in training |
| 2025            | Deployment     | Live predictions                             |

**Critical Rule**: **Never** include 2024 data in training. This is the locked holdout for all V2 experiments.

**COVID Exclusion**: 2020 excluded due to season disruptions (shortened schedule, opt-outs).

---

### Training Steps

1. **Load Data**:

   ```bash
   uv run python src/features/v1_pipeline.py \
       --years 2019,2021,2022,2023,2024
   ```

2. **Train Model**:

   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=. uv run python src/train.py \
       model=linear \
       features=minimal_unadjusted_v1 \
       training.train_years=[2019,2021,2022,2023] \
       training.test_year=2024
   ```

3. **Log to MLflow**:
   - Experiment: `v2_baseline`
   - Run name: `ridge_minimal_v1`
   - Metrics: `rmse`, `mae`, `hit_rate`, `roi`

---

## Expected Performance

### Hypothesis

**RMSE**: 12-14 points (spread prediction error)  
**Hit Rate**: 51-53% (against closing line, ATS)  
**ROI**: -2% to +2% (near breakeven with -110 odds)

**Rationale**:

- Unadjusted EPA is moderately predictive but known to be biased by schedule strength
- Linear model cannot capture non-linear interactions
- This sets a realistic floor for Phase 2/3 improvements

### Promotion Criteria for Phase 2

To graduate to Phase 2 (Feature Engineering & Selection):

- [ ] Baseline documented in MLflow with full metrics
- [ ] Performance within expected range (not anomalous)
- [ ] Reproducible (can re-run and get same results ±1%)

## Path to V2 Champion

This baseline is **not** intended to be the final production model. It is the starting point of a rigorous journey:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Phase 1: Ridge Baseline] --> B[Phase 2: Feature Engineering]
    B --> C[Phase 3: Model Selection]
    C --> D[Phase 4: Deployment]

    B -->|If +1.0% ROI| E[Promote Features]
    C -->|If +1.5% ROI| F[Promote Model = Champion]
    F --> D
```

**Timeline**:

- **Week 1-2**: Establish this baseline
- **Week 3-6**: Phase 2 — Test opponent adjustment, recency weighting
- **Week 7-10**: Phase 3 — Test CatBoost, XGBoost on best features
- **Week 11-12**: Phase 4 — Deploy Champion Model

**Success = Beating this baseline through rigorous, gated promotion**
