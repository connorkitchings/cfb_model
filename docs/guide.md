## 🎯 V2 Experimentation Workflow (NEW)

**Status**: Implementation starting Week 1 (Dec 9, 2025)

The project follows a **4-phase V2 workflow** for all modeling work:

1. **Phase 1: Baseline Establishment** → Ridge regression with minimal features
2. **Phase 2: Feature Engineering & Selection** → Test features with baseline model
3. **Phase 3: Model Selection** → Test complex models with promot features
4. **Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring** → Champion Model to production

**Key Documents**:

- [V2 Workflow](process/experimentation_workflow.md) — Full 4-phase process
- [12-Week Plan](process/12_week_implementation_plan.md) — Week-by-week roadmap
- [Promotion Framework](process/promotion_framework.md) — 5-gate rigor system
- [V2 Baseline](modeling/baseline.md) — Ridge regression philosophy

### Data Pipeline Flow

1.  **Raw Ingestion** → Fetch from CollegeFootballData.com API into local raw storage.
2.  **Aggregation** → Run `scripts/pipeline/run_pipeline_generic.py` to transform raw plays into aggregated `byplay`, `drives`, and `team_game` datasets in processed storage.
3.  **Validation** → Run `scripts/pipeline/validate_data.py` to verify the quality and integrity of the aggregated data.
4.  **Feature Engineering** → Generate point-in-time, opponent-adjusted features for modeling (`team_week_adj`).
5.  **Modeling** → Train models using the V2 Experimentation Workflow.
6.  **Inference** → Derive spreads/totals, calculate edges, and apply betting policy.

---

## 🎯 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for MLflow and dashboard services
- CollegeFootballData.com API key
- External storage drive (for data)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/connorkitchings/cfb_model.git
cd cfb_model

# Install dependencies
uv sync --extra dev

# Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set:
#   CFB_MODEL_DATA_ROOT='/path/to/external/drive'
#   CFBD_API_KEY='your_api_key'

# Verify installation
uv run pytest -q
uv run ruff check .
```

### Essential Environment Variables

**CRITICAL**: All raw and processed data lives on an external drive, NOT in the project directory.

```bash
# Required
CFB_MODEL_DATA_ROOT='/Volumes/CK SSD/Coding Projects/cfb_model/'  # External drive path
CFBD_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'                                   # API access

# Optional
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI='file://./artifacts/mlruns'                    # MLflow storage
```

**Always verify before ANY data operation**:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

data_root = os.getenv("CFB_MODEL_DATA_ROOT")
assert data_root and Path(data_root).exists(), f"Data root not accessible: {data_root}"
```

### Data Pipeline Flow

1. **Raw Ingestion** → Fetch from CollegeFootballData.com API
2. **Aggregation** → Plays → Drives → Team-Game → Team-Season
3. **Feature Engineering** → Opponent adjustment, recency weighting, interactions
4. **Modeling** → Points-For architecture (predict home/away scores)
5. **Inference** → Derive spreads/totals, calculate edges, apply policy

See [Weekly Pipeline](ops/weekly_pipeline.md) for production workflow.

## 📊 Key Performance Metrics

**Definitions** (see [Modeling Baseline](modeling/baseline.md)):

- **Hit Rate**: Percentage of correct predictions against the spread/total
- **Breakeven**: 52.4% hit rate required to profit at -110 odds
- **ROI**: Return on investment assuming -110 juice
- **Volume**: Number of bets meeting threshold criteria

**Current Status (2025 Live Performance)**:

- Spread: 50.1% hit rate (237-236-11) — Below breakeven ⚠️
- Total: 51.4% hit rate (95-90-0) — Below breakeven ⚠️

See [Experiments Index](experiments/index.md) for detailed tracking.

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls

### 1. Data Not on External Drive

**Problem**: Script creates `./data/` in project root
**Solution**: Always load `CFB_MODEL_DATA_ROOT` from env; fail loudly if not set

### 2. Train/Test Data Leakage

**Problem**: Including test year in training data
**Solution**: Use locked split: Train on 2019/2021-2023, Test on 2024, Deploy on 2025

### 3. Hardcoded Paths

**Problem**: Using `/Users/...` or `./data/`
**Solution**: Always use `os.getenv("CFB_MODEL_DATA_ROOT")`

### 4. Modifying Betting Policy in Code

**Problem**: Changing unit sizing or exposure rules programmatically
**Solution**: Only read and apply policy from [Betting Policy](modeling/betting_policy.md)

See [Data Paths](ops/data_paths.md) for full troubleshooting.
