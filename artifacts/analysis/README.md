# Analysis Directory

This directory is your personal workspace for ad-hoc analysis, exploration, and investigations.

## Purpose

- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature investigation notebooks
- Model diagnostics
- One-off experiments
- Personal scripts

## Structure

Suggested organization (but flexible):

```
analysis/
├── feature_exploration/
│   └── notebooks/
├── model_diagnostics/
│   └── calibration_analysis.ipynb
└── reports/
    └── findings.md
```

## .gitignore

**This entire directory is excluded from git** (.gitignore entry).

Why? Personal workspace, large notebooks, temporary files.

Only this README is committed.

## Usage

Feel free to organize however you like. This space is for you to explore without worrying about project structure constraints.

**Note**: If you create something valuable here that should be shared, move it to the appropriate project location and document it.
