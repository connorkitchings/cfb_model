- ✅ Streamlined documentation
- ✅ Legacy code cleanup

### ⏱️ Timeline
**12 days total** - Can be spread across multiple sessions

### 💰 Costs
- Cloud storage: ~$2-5/month (Cloudflare R2 recommended)
- One-time migration: Free

### 🔴 Critical Requirements
- [ ] Cloudflare or AWS account for Phase 2
- [ ] External drive connected ONLY for Days 3-5

2. Document any pre-commit hook issues

---

### Phase 5: Legacy Deletion (Day 10)
**Status:** ⏸️ Waiting
**Drive Required:** ❌ No
**Effort:** 1 day

#### Goals
- Delete `legacy/` directory entirely (189MB, 594 files)
- Delete `scripts/archive/` (8 obsolete files)
- Delete `conf/legacy/` (18 old configs)
- Clean break - no archival (Git history serves as backup)

#### Rationale
User decision: Delete permanently. The legacy/ directory has:
- No active imports (verified via grep)
- MLflow history already in artifacts/mlruns/
- Old model artifacts duplicated elsewhere
- No unique valuable code after exploration

#### Checklist
- [ ] Verify no imports from legacy/: `grep -r "from legacy\|import legacy" src/ scripts/`
- [ ] Verify no imports from scripts/archive/: `grep -r "scripts\.archive" src/ scripts/`
- [ ] Run tests to confirm no dependencies: `uv run pytest -q` (should pass)
- [ ] Delete legacy/: `rm -rf legacy/`
- [ ] Delete scripts/archive/: `rm -rf scripts/archive/`
- [ ] Delete conf/legacy/: `rm -rf conf/legacy/`
- [ ] Run tests again: `uv run pytest -q` (should still pass)
- [ ] Commit deletion with message: `chore: Remove 189MB legacy/ directory - clean break, git history preserved`
- [ ] Document in session log: what was deleted and rationale

#### Session Handoff
**If ending session mid-phase:**
1. Note which directories have been verified/deleted
2. If deletion fails tests, document the failure for investigation

---

### Phase 6: Integration & Validation (Days 11-12)
**Status:** ⏸️ Waiting  
**Drive Required:** ❌ No  
**Effort:** 2 days

#### Goals
- Run end-to-end pipeline tests
- Validate cloud storage integration
- Test documentation builds
- Final review and cleanup

#### Checklist
- [ ] Run health check script: `sh .agent/workflows/health-check.sh` (all green)
- [ ] Run full test suite: `uv run pytest -v` (47+ tests pass)
- [ ] Build documentation: `mkdocs build --strict` (no errors)
- [ ] Verify AI entry points:
  - [ ] AGENTS.md → loads in <2 min
  - [ ] .agent/CONTEXT.md → provides project-specific knowledge
  - [ ] .codex/QUICKSTART.md → has essential commands
- [ ] Test cloud storage: Read a sample dataset from R2/S3
- [ ] Verify external drive not needed: Disconnect drive, run health checks
- [ ] Create completion session log documenting:
  - What changed (summary of all 6 phases)
  - New file structure
  - How to onboard new AI assistants
  - V2 workflow resumption plan

#### Session Handoff
**If ending session mid-phase:**
1. Document which validation checks have passed
2. Note any remaining issues or test failures

## Data Storage Strategy

### Recommended: Cloudflare R2

**Why R2 over AWS S3:**
- ✅ No egress fees (unlimited downloads)
- ✅ Lower cost ($0.015/GB vs $0.023/GB)
- ✅ S3-compatible API
- ✅ Better for data science workloads

### Bucket Structure
```
s3://cfb-model-data/
├── raw/                    # API responses
│   ├── plays/
│   ├── games/
│   └── teams/
├── processed/              # Aggregated features
│   ├── byplay/
│   ├── drives/
│   ├── team_game/
│   └── team_season/
├── models/                 # Serialized models
├── artifacts/              # MLflow artifacts
└── backups/                # Point-in-time snapshots
```

### Migration Approach: Shadow Mode

**Week 1-2: Dual Write**
```python
# Write to both locations
data.to_parquet(local_path)      # Existing
data.to_parquet(s3_path)         # New
```

**Week 3+: Switch Reads**
```python
# Read from S3 (validated)
data = pd.read_parquet(s3_path)
```

**Week 5+: Cleanup**
- Disconnect external drive
- Keep as emergency backup

### Cost Estimation

| Service | Storage | Egress | Total/Month |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| AWS S3 | $0.023/GB | $0.09/GB | $3-7 |
| Cloudflare R2 | $0.015/GB | Free | $1-2 |

**Estimated data size:** 50-100GB  
**Recommended:** Cloudflare R2 (~$2/month)

---

## Session Log Template

When working on this refactoring, create session logs in:
```
session_logs/YYYY-MM-DD/NN.md
```

Use this format:
```markdown
# Session: Refactoring Phase X - [Brief Description]

## TL;DR
- **Phase:** X of 6
- **Worked On:** [What was done]
- **Completed:** [What was finished]
- **Blockers:** [Any issues]
- **Next:** [What's next]

## Changes Made
- File 1: [description]
- File 2: [description]

## Testing
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Documentation builds

## Notes for Next Session
[Context to carry forward]
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If anything goes wrong:

1. **Code issues:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git branch -D refactor/template-adoption
   ```

2. **Data issues:**
   - Reconnect external drive
   - Switch `CFB_STORAGE_BACKEND=local`
   - All data still on drive

3. **Cloud issues:**
   - Keep local copies during migration
   - Versioned storage allows rollback
   - External drive as ultimate backup
