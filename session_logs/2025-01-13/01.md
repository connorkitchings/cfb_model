branch: main
task: IMPL-task:11 - Implement iterative opponent adjustment pipeline
---

## Wins

- Successfully fixed and debugged the aggregation preprocessing pipeline for 2023 season data
- Resolved missing function reference (`calculate_luck_factor`) that was blocking pipeline execution
- Added missing defensive drives aggregation (`def_drv_agg`) that was referenced but undefined
- Fixed column naming inconsistencies in opponent adjustment logic (defensive metrics using `_allowed` suffix)
- Implemented graceful handling of missing columns for optional metrics (special teams, field goals)
- Completed full 2023 season aggregation preprocessing with 40+ team-game metrics
- Successfully tested 4-iteration opponent adjustment with recency weighting (3/2/1 pattern)
- Verified drive-level aggregations working correctly alongside play-level aggregations

## Blockers

- Multiple undefined references in existing code that had to be identified and fixed through iterative debugging
- Complex column naming patterns between offensive (`off_`) and defensive metrics (`def_` vs `def_*_allowed`) required comprehensive mapping
- Missing special teams defensive metrics created edge cases requiring defensive programming

## Artifacts & Links

- Learnings: [KB:OpponentAdjustmentDebugging] - Systematic approach to fixing undefined references and column mismatches in aggregation pipelines
- Code Health: Fixed aggregation core functionality in `src/cfb_model/data/aggregations/core.py`
- Sprint Progress: Completed Sprint 2 Task 11 (8-day effort) - Foundation for all subsequent modeling work

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Opponent adjustment pipeline (Task 11) is complete and tested with 2023 season data
- Next Immediate Task: Ridge model training + prediction scripts (Task 12) - 5-day effort for baseline regression models
- Known Issues: None - pipeline is stable and ready for modeling
- Next Session Context: Ready to begin Ridge regression implementation for spread/total predictions, with feature engineering foundation now complete
