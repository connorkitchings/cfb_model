task: [IMPL-task:34] - Systematic feature selection
---

## Wins

- Executed a full, multi-stage feature selection experiment to identify a smaller, more predictive feature set.
- Successfully identified and fixed a recurring data pipeline bug where processed data was not found by downstream scripts.
- Traced the pipeline issue to its root causes: incorrect `data_root` pathing and a mismatch between partitioned data writing and monolithic data reading logic.
- Refactored the data loading logic in `src/cfb_model/models/features.py` to be compatible with the weekly partitioned data, making the pipeline more robust.
- Confirmed that reverting to the full feature set restored the model's higher performance (54.6% hit rate).

## Blockers

- The feature selection experiment, while successful in reducing feature count, resulted in a model with a lower hit rate (52.3%) than the baseline.
- The debugging process was prolonged due to a layered data issue that required fixing both the data ingestion and data loading steps.

## Artifacts & Links

- Decisions: `[PRD-decision:2025-10-07]` - Reverted the feature selection experiment.
- Learnings: `[KB:FeatureSelectionValidation]` - Feature selection is not a guaranteed improvement and must be validated.

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point**: The feature selection experiment is complete. The codebase has been reverted to its previous, higher-performing state. All data pipeline issues discovered during the process have been fixed.
- **Next Immediate Task**: Re-evaluate the model improvement strategy. Since feature selection was not successful, the next best step is likely to focus on the other high-priority items from the backlog, such as further variance reduction techniques or exploring alternative model architectures like XGBoost.
- **Known Issues**: None. The project is in a stable and profitable state.
- **Next Session Context**: The systematic feature selection path has been explored and determined to be less effective than the current full-feature approach. The project is ready to explore other avenues for performance improvement.
