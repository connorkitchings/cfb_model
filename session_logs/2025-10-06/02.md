# Session Log: 2025-10-06

## 1. Session Summary

**Task Completed:** `[IMPL-task:34] - [Advanced Feature Engineering and Selection]`

**Key Outcomes:**

- Added new features to the aggregation pipeline: average starting field position.
- Ran model improvement experiments to evaluate the new features.
- Identified and resolved a data pipeline issue that was preventing the `team_game` data from being generated correctly.
- Fixed a failing test in `test_aggregate_team_game_minimal.py`.

## 2. Blockers & Learnings

- **Blockers Encountered:** The data pipeline was not generating the `team_game` data, which blocked the model experiments. This was resolved by debugging the aggregation scripts and realizing the raw data was missing.
- **New Learnings/Patterns:** Always verify that the raw data exists before running aggregations.

## 3. Next Steps

- **Immediate Next Task:** Implement a systematic feature selection process using filter and embedded methods (Lasso) as outlined in the feature engineering guide.

## 4. Final Health Check

- `uv run ruff check .`: All checks passed!
- `uv run ruff format .`: 46 files left unchanged
- `uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short`: 27 passed in 4.10s
- `uv run mkdocs build --quiet`: Success
