branch: main
task: [IMPL-task:DEVOPS-01] - Organize and commit all work-in-progress changes, merge to main, and clean up branches.
---

## Wins

- Successfully organized a large number of uncommitted changes into a series of clean, atomic commits.
- Created a new `run_weekly_pipeline.sh` script to provide a single entry point for the entire weekly workflow.
- Cleaned up the repository by adding generated directories (`reports/`, `models/`) and system files (`.DS_Store`) to `.gitignore`.
- Safely merged the feature branch into `main` and deleted the old branches, leaving the repository in a clean state.

## Blockers

- Encountered minor shell interpretation issues with multi-line `git commit` messages, which were resolved by using a safer command format.

## Artifacts & Links

- Learnings: `[KB:AtomicCommits]`, `[KB:GitignoreMaintenance]`, `[KB:SafeBranchMerge]`.
- Code Health: All checks passed (Ruff format/lint, Pytest, MkDocs build).

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: All work from the `feature/kelly-sizing-ops-2025-10-02` branch has been committed and merged into `main`. The repository is clean.
- Next Immediate Task: Run the new `run_weekly_pipeline.sh` script for an upcoming week to perform a full end-to-end test of the automated workflow.
- Known Issues: None.
- Next Session Context: The `main` branch is up-to-date and stable. The next session can focus on running the pipeline or starting new feature work.
