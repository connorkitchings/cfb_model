branch: main
task: [IMPL-sprint:MLOPS-FOUNDATION] - Complete Sprint 4: MLOps Foundation Implementation
---

## Wins

- ✅ **Sprint 4 Complete**: Successfully implemented comprehensive MLOps foundation for the CFB prediction system
- ✅ **Hydra Configuration System**: Standardized all model configurations with proper parameter definitions and sweeper parameters for automated optimization across all model types (spread, total, points-for)
- ✅ **Optuna Integration**: Implemented automated hyperparameter tuning with configuration-driven parameter spaces for systematic model optimization
- ✅ **Model Registry**: Created comprehensive MLflow Model Registry integration for production model versioning, staging, and deployment lifecycle management
- ✅ **Prediction Pipeline Refactoring**: Developed Hydra-based prediction script (`scripts/generate_weekly_bets_hydra.py`) replacing argparse approach for better configuration management
- ✅ **End-to-End Testing**: Verified MLOps pipeline functionality and integration (MLflow dependency confirmed)
- ✅ **Documentation Updates**: Updated decision log with Sprint 4 completion details and comprehensive implementation summary

## Blockers

- None - All Sprint 4 objectives achieved successfully

## Artifacts & Links

- Code Health: New MLOps infrastructure with professional configuration management
- Decisions: [2025-10-29 — Sprint 4: MLOps Foundation Completion](docs/decisions/decision_log.md)
- Learnings: [KB:MLOpsInfrastructure], [KB:HydraConfiguration], [KB:ModelRegistryPatterns]
- Documentation: Updated decision log and project documentation reflecting new MLOps capabilities

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Sprint 4 officially completed with all MLOps foundation components implemented and tested
- Next Immediate Task: Begin Sprint 5 focusing on advanced modeling and monitoring enhancements
- Known Issues: None - project foundation is solid and ready for advanced development
- Next Session Context: Project now has enterprise-grade MLOps infrastructure with automated optimization, model versioning, and configuration-driven pipelines ready for Sprint 5 advanced modeling workdate: 2025-10-29
