task: IMPL-THRESHOLDS - Set totals default threshold to 5.5 and document session
---

## Wins

- Generated and scored 2024 season bets by week (weeks 5–16) using current models
- Separated spread vs total bets and produced weekly/overall summaries
- Ran threshold sweeps for spreads and totals; selected totals default 5.5 based on 2024 results
- Updated defaults and docs: totals `--total-threshold` now 5.5 in runner and weekly generator; docs adjusted; decision log entry added

## Blockers

- Minor: Lint issues flagged by Ruff in several scripts (import order, whitespace, trailing newline). Deferred auto-fix to avoid noisy diffs.
- Note: run_full_season combined output path print previously showed a nested path (reports/2024/2024/...). File writes were correct; message can be harmonized in a follow-up.

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Totals default threshold set to 5.5 across code and docs; season analysis complete.
- Next Immediate Task: Optionally re-run 2024 season with the new totals default to produce updated scored outputs and ROI; fix Ruff issues with `uv run ruff format .` (or `--fix`).
- Known Issues: Lint findings (import sort, whitespace, trailing newline). Minor runner print path inconsistency.
- Next Session Context: Consider ROI and unit sizing analysis by bet type; evaluate per-week performance stability and edge calibration.

## Health Check

- Format check: `uv run ruff format --check .` → 7 files would be reformatted.
- Lint: `uv run ruff check .` → 11 issues (all fixable): import sorting (I001), whitespace (W293), trailing newline (W292), one unused import (F401).
- Tests: `uv run pytest -q` → 14 passed in ~6.3s
- Docs: `uv run mkdocs build --strict --quiet` → success
