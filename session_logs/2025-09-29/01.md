task: [IMPL-task:refactor-pipeline] - Refactor and optimize the weekly prediction pipeline
---

## Wins

- Successfully refactored the weekly prediction pipeline to use a caching mechanism (`processed/team_week_adj/`), significantly improving performance.
- Unified multiple script entry points (`run_full_season.py`, `run_ingestion_year.py`) into a single, robust CLI (`scripts/cli.py`), improving usability.
- Removed legacy code (`src/cfb_model/models/train_model.py`) and fixed inconsistencies in tests and documentation.
- Added new decisions and knowledge base articles to document the changes and learnings from the session.

## Blockers

- Initial script execution failed due to path issues (`python` vs `python3`); resolved by adhering to the project standard of using `uv run`.
- The caching script failed initially due to an incorrect `LocalStorage.write()` method call; this was debugged by inspecting the method definition and correcting the arguments.
- Health checks failed post-refactoring due to a test case importing the deleted module; resolved by updating the test.

## Artifacts & Links

- Decisions: `[PRD-decision:2025-09-29]`
- Learnings: `[KB:LocalStorageWriteSignature]`, `[KB:EntityPartitioningSpecificity]`
- Code Health: All `ruff` and `pytest` checks passed after fixes were implemented.

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: The pipeline optimization is complete and verified. The codebase is clean, tested, and all relevant documentation has been updated.
- Next Immediate Task: Begin the model improvement phase. This could involve experimenting with new features, alternative model architectures (e.g., XGBoost), or hyperparameter tuning.
- Known Issues: None.
- Next Session Context: The codebase is now faster and more organized, providing a solid foundation for the next phase of model development.
