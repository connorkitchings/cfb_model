task: [IMPL-task:35] - Refactor hyperparameter optimization script to use Hydra and Optuna.
---

## Wins

- Refactored `scripts/optimize_hyperparameters.py` to use Hydra for configuration and Optuna for optimization.
- Created Hydra configuration files for Ridge and RandomForest models (`conf/optimize_ridge.yaml`, `conf/optimize_random_forest.yaml`).
- Added `hydra-joblib-launcher` dependency.
- Debugged and fixed `NaN` value errors in the optimization script.
- Updated project documentation to reflect the new MLOps stack.

## Blockers

- The Hydra Optuna sweeper had issues with the search space defined in the config file when using multirun.
- Shell command syntax errors when passing complex arguments.
- `ValueError: Input X contains NaN` in the optimization script.

## Artifacts & Links

- Learnings: `[KB:HydraMultiRunConfig]` - When using Hydra's multirun with the Optuna sweeper, the search space might need to be passed via the command line instead of being defined in the config file.
- Learnings: `[KB:ShellQuoting]` - Complex shell command arguments with parentheses need to be properly quoted to avoid syntax errors.
- Learnings: `[KB:ImputeNaNs]` - `NaN` values in the input data for scikit-learn models can be handled by using an imputer or by filling them with a specific value (e.g., 0).

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: The hyperparameter optimization script has been refactored, but is not yet successfully running with the Optuna sweeper.
- Next Immediate Task: Resolve the remaining issues with the Hydra Optuna sweeper to run the hyperparameter optimization successfully. Then, run the optimization for both spread and total models, analyze the results, and update the default model parameters.
- Known Issues: The Hydra Optuna sweeper is not working as expected with the current configuration.
- Next Session Context: The project has a refactored hyperparameter optimization script that needs further debugging to work with the Hydra Optuna sweeper.
