branch: main
task: [IMPL-task:FE-PLAN] - Finalize roadmap and feature engineering documentation
---

## Wins

- Reconciled ingestion vs training scope across docs; clarified 2015–2024 ingested vs 2014–2024
  (excl. 2020) training window.
- Finalized feature engineering specs in `docs/project_org/feature_catalog.md` including play
  filters, explosive buckets, possession metrics, and iterative opponent-adjustment (4 iters, 3/2/1 recency).
- Recorded decision in `docs/decisions/decision_log.md` (2025-08-12) and aligned
  `docs/planning/roadmap.md` acceptance criteria; fixed a markdown line-length lint.

## Blockers

- Historical plays verification discrepancy noted previously (only ~1,000 plays visible vs 1.28M+
  ingested). Needs investigation before heavy feature builds.
- 2014 backfill for ingestion still pending to fully match training window.

## Artifacts & Links

- Decisions: [PRD-decision:2025-08-12]
- Feature Catalog: `docs/project_org/feature_catalog.md`
- Roadmap: `docs/planning/roadmap.md`
- Ingestion Scope: `docs/cfbd/data_ingestion.md`
- Decision Log: `docs/decisions/decision_log.md`

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Documentation unified; roadmap and feature spec finalized and linked.
- Next Immediate Task: Scaffold feature build CLI and modules (`src/cfb_model/features/`):
  season-to-date with recency weights; 4-iter opponent adjustment; validators; emit Parquet +
  manifest + seasonal summary CSV.
- Known Issues: Plays verification discrepancy; 2014 ingestion backfill.
- Next Session Context: Start with feature pipeline scaffolding and a small year (e.g., 2015) to
  validate outputs and checks before scaling.
