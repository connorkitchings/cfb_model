# Session Log: 2025-08-02

## 1. Context & Objectives

- **Objective**: Complete the project setup by reviewing and updating the `uv.lock` file for package
  update opportunities.
- **Initial State**: All documentation and configuration files were project-specific, but the
  `uv.lock` file's health was unknown.

## 2. Actions Taken

1. **Dependency Audit**: Began by running `uv pip list --outdated`, which incorrectly reported no
  available updates.
2. **Investigation**: Manually checked key packages (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `streamlit`) against
  PyPI and discovered that while most packages were up-to-date, `streamlit` was completely missing
  from the `uv.lock` file.
3. **Diagnosis**: Further investigation using `uv pip compile` revealed that the `uv.lock` file was
  corrupted and could not be parsed.
4. **Resolution**: Deleted the corrupted `uv.lock` file and regenerated a new one from
  `pyproject.toml`. This action successfully resolved all dependency issues and updated packages to
  their latest versions.

## 3. Key Outcomes & Decisions

- **Outcome**: The project's dependencies are now healthy, up-to-date, and correctly locked in a
  new `uv.lock` file.
- **Decision**: No new strategic decisions were made. The focus was on technical remediation.

## 4. Next Steps

- **[PRD-feat:A]**: Confirm the correct Supabase project to use for `cfb_model`.
- **[PRD-feat:A]**: Apply the initial database schema migration to the confirmed Supabase project.
- **[PRD-feat:B]**: Begin development of the data ingestion pipeline.
