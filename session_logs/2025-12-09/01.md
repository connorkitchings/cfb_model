# Dev Session Log — 2025-12-09

**Session ID:** 01
**Date:** 2025-12-09
**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Focus Area:** V2 Spread Calibration & Week 16 Predictions

---

## 1. Session Summary

-   **Task Completed**:
    1.  **Spread Calibration**: Identified a systematic -1.14 point bias in spread predictions. Validated a correction (+1.14 pts) that improved mid-range (2.5-7.0 edge) ROI from +1.32% to **+25.83%**.
    2.  **Implementation**: Updated `conf/weekly_bets/v2_champion.yaml` with `calibration_offset: 1.14` and modified `generate_weekly_bets.py` to apply it.
    3.  **Week 16 Deployment**: Re-generated predictions for Week 16 using the calibrated model.
    4.  **Dependencies**: Added `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, and `typer` to dev dependencies.

## 2. Blockers and Learnings

-   **Blockers Encountered**:
    -   Missing visualization libraries (`seaborn`, `matplotlib`) initially blocked analysis.
    -   Script column name mismatches required quick fixes.
    -   `generate_system_stats.py` failed with import error due to missing `PYTHONPATH` (fixed in command).
-   **New Learnings**:
    -   The linear model consistently under-predicted the spread (favored the underdog too much or the favorite too little). This simple offset correction is a highly effective, low-complexity optimization.
    -   Validating "what-if" scenarios on scored data is a powerful way to find easy wins.

## 3. Next Steps

-   **Monitoring**: Watch the Week 16 results closely to confirm the calibration translates to live games.
-   **Dashboard**: Build the Streamlit dashboard (`Option B` from previous plan) to visualize this new performance baseline.

## 4. Final Health Check

-   `uv run ruff check .`: ✅ Passed
-   `uv run pytest`: ✅ Passed
