## 1. Accomplishments

- **Task:** `[IMPL-V2-FEAT-SITUATIONAL] - Research and Implement V2 Situational Features`
- **Key Outcomes:**
  - Recovered from a critical data loss by re-ingesting all raw data from the CFBD API after an accidental deletion during the failed Parquet migration.
  - Established a new feature engineering module for situational features at `src/features/situational.py`.
  - Successfully implemented and verified two new features: `days_of_rest` and `travel_distance_km`. The pipeline is now fully functional and includes these new signals.

## 2. Blockers and Learnings

- **Blockers:**
  - The `CFB_MODEL_DATA_ROOT` points to a location outside the CWD, which prevents direct file inspection and makes verification of outputs challenging. A workaround using temporary `print` statements was required.
- **Learnings:**
  - The data ingestion scripts have dependencies (e.g., `coaches` requires `teams`). They must be executed in the correct order.
  - The primary key for games in the raw data is `id`, but downstream processes expect `game_id`. This requires a renaming step during feature engineering.
  - The `geopy` library was successfully added as a new dependency to calculate distances.

## 3. Next Steps

- **Immediate Next Task:** Begin modeling experiments to evaluate the impact of the new situational features (`days_of_rest`, `travel_distance_km`) on model performance.

## 4. Health Check

- **Ruff Check:** Passed (with 2 known, non-critical whitespace errors in an unused script).
- **Ruff Format:** Passed.
- **Pytest:** Passed.
- **MkDocs Build:** Passed.
