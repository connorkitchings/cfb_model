# Dev Session Log — 2025-12-09

**Session ID:** 02
**Date:** 2025-12-09
**Duration:** ~15 mins
**Focus Area:** Architecture Planning (DB vs Parquet)

---

## 1. Session Summary

-   **Task**: Investigated replacing the file-based system with a Database (SQL/Postgres).
-   **Decision**: Rejected full DB migration in favor of a **Parquet-based "Lakehouse" approach**.
    -   *Rationale*: A full DB migration requires high effort (rewriting 50+ I/O calls) and adds infrastructure complexity (server management). Parquet offers the desired benefits (type safety, speed, compression) with significantly lower friction for a batch-processing ML workload.
-   **Outcome**: Created `docs/planning/parquet_migration_plan.md` detailing the 3-phase strategy to migrate from CSV to Parquet.

## 2. Next Steps

-   **Execution**: Execute the Parquet migration plan in a future sprint (post-CFP).
