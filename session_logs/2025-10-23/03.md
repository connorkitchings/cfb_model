task: Session wrap — document FCS limitation in unadjusted analysis
---

## Summary

- Confirmed the current `analysis_cli` leaderboards still reflect FBS regular-season games (Georgia now shows 11 games played) and captured the top-25 outputs for offense and defense YPP.
- Added a caveat to `docs/operations/weekly_pipeline.md` noting that the CFBD feed can occasionally present FCS opponents as FBS, which affects downstream leaderboards and scatter plots.
- Regenerated the rush-vs-pass unadjusted scatter (`artifacts/reports/plots/offense_rush_vs_pass_ypp_2024.png`) using the latest CLI logic so visuals match the documented limitation.

## Blockers

- CFBD metadata occasionally tags FCS opponents in a way that passes our filters (e.g., Boise State vs. Portland State), so certain teams may still display 12 games despite an FCS matchup. Further remediation would require deeper data reconciliation beyond today’s scope.

## Learnings

- Relying solely on CFBD’s `season_type` and classification fields is insufficient for perfect FBS-only filtering; documentation needs to reflect the manual validation step.

## Next Steps

- Evaluate whether future aggregation scripts (training, reporting) need explicit opponent cross-checks or manual overrides to guarantee FBS-only data.
- Monitor CFBD classification updates and revisit the filtering logic once more reliable identifiers are available.
