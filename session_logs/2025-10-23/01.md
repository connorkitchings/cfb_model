branch: main
task: [IMPL-task:MLOPS-FINALIZE] - Finalize MLOps integration and evaluate advanced features.
---

## Wins

- Successfully tuned the hyperparameters for the `spread_ridge` and `total_random_forest` models, and updated the configurations.
- Prototyped and evaluated the "points-for" model, confirming it is a promising approach for totals but not for spreads.
- Conducted a feature selection experiment for the points-for model and found that a smaller feature set did not improve performance.
- Evaluated the impact of the advanced rushing analytics features and found them to have minimal impact on model performance.

## Blockers

- `uv run` command panics in the environment, requiring the use of `source .venv/bin/activate` as a workaround.
- Encountered and fixed several `ModuleNotFoundError`, `ValueError`, and `TypeError` issues during the session.

## Artifacts & Links

- Learnings: `[KB:PYTHONPATH-FOR-MODULES]`, `[KB:HydraMultiRunConfig]`, `[KB:ShellQuoting]`, `[KB:ImputeNaNs]`

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point:** All planned tasks for the session are complete. The MLOps integration is finalized, and the advanced features have been evaluated.
- **Next Immediate Task:** Based on the findings, the next logical step is to focus on improving the `points-for` model for totals, perhaps by exploring different regularization techniques or other models. For spreads, the legacy ensemble remains the better choice.
- **Known Issues:** The `uv run` command issue persists.
- **Next Session Context:** The project is in a stable state with a clear path forward for model improvement.
