task: [IMPL-task:POINTS-FOR-EVAL] - Adapt walk-forward validation and experiment with XGBoost
---

## Summary

This session focused on advancing the points-for modeling initiative. The primary achievement was adapting the walk-forward validation framework to support the points-for model, which allowed for a direct comparison with the legacy ensemble. We then proceeded to experiment with XGBoost as a more powerful alternative for the points-for model, which involved adding the necessary dependencies and configurations for hyperparameter tuning.

## Wins

- Successfully adapted `scripts/walk_forward_validation.py` to train and evaluate the points-for models, including calculating derived totals and logging performance metrics.
- Ran the adapted walk-forward validation and confirmed that the baseline points-for model is competitive with the legacy ensemble for totals prediction.
- Integrated the `xgboost` library into the project and created the necessary Hydra configurations for the model and its hyperparameter sweeper.

## Blockers

- Encountered and resolved several issues while attempting to run the hyperparameter optimization for XGBoost, including:
    - Missing `xgboost` and `libomp` dependencies.
    - Incorrect Hydra configurations for the model's `name` and `type`.
- Was unable to programmatically retrieve the results from the MLflow server, which prevented the automatic selection of the best hyperparameters.

## Learnings

- `xgboost` has a system-level dependency on `libomp` on macOS, which needs to be installed via Homebrew.
- Hydra configurations are sensitive to the `name` and `type` fields, which must be set correctly for the scripts to function as expected.
- Programmatic access to the MLflow server can be complex and may require further debugging to work reliably in this environment.

## Next Steps

- **Immediate Next Task:** Manually retrieve the best hyperparameters for the XGBoost model from the MLflow UI and update the `conf/model/points_for_xgboost.yaml` file. After that, re-run the walk-forward validation to benchmark the performance of the tuned XGBoost model against the baseline points-for model and the legacy ensemble.
