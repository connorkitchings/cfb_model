# Dev Session Log — 2025-12-07

**Session ID:** 02
**Date:** 2025-12-07
**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Focus Area:** V2 Phase 2.5 (Recency) & Phase 4 (Stacking)

---

## 1. Session Summary

- **Key Outcomes**:
  1.  **Phase 2.5 Recency Weighting**: Implemented Exponential Decay Aggregator (`v2_recency.py`).
      - **Result**: Experiment 07 achieved **-0.15% ROI** (virtually break-even), hit rate 52.3%.
      - **Outcome**: Promoted to **CHAMPION**, replacing the -0.97% Baseline.
  2.  **Phase 4 Stacking**: Implemented K-Fold Stacking Ensemble (`v2_stacking.py`).
      - **Result**: Experiment 08 achieved **-5.36% ROI**.
      - **Outcome**: Failed. Meta-model struggled to find signal.
  3.  **Phase 3.5 Tuning**: Tuned XGBoost (-1.23% ROI) failed to beat untuned (-0.71%).

## 2. Blockers and Learnings

- **Simplicity Wins**: The single most effective change was Recency Weighting (simple math), beating complex models (XGBoost) and complex architectures (Stacking).
- **Signal Problem**: We confirmed that models are starved for signal. Stacking failed because the base models are highly correlated.

## 3. Next Steps

- **Immediate**: Deploy Recency Model for 2025 predictions.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Implement **Interaction Terms** (e.g. `off_epa * def_epa_allowed`).
  - Implement **Matchup Specifics** (Run Offense vs Run Defense).

## 4. Health Check

- Linter: Fixed issues in new V2 models.
- Tests: Passed.
