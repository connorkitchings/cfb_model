# Dev Session Log — 2025-12-07

**Session ID:** 01
**Date:** 2025-12-07
**Duration:** ~1.5 hours
**Focus Area:** V2 Workflow (Phase 1-3)

---

## 1. Session Summary

- **Key Outcomes**:
  1.  **Phase 1 Cleanup**: Committed baseline files (ROI -3.35%).
  2.  **Phase 2 Features**: Promoted `opponent_adjusted_v1` (ROI -0.97%).
  3.  **Data Quality**: Implemented validation suite and fixed a 2024 data bug (filtered incomplete games).
  4.  **Phase 3 Model Selection**:
      - Tested CatBoost (-1.76% ROI) and XGBoost (-0.71% ROI).
      - **Result**: Failed to meet +1.5% promotion target.
      - **Decision**: Maintained Linear Baseline as Champion.

## 2. Blockers and Learnings

- **XGBoost Promise**: XGBoost beat the baseline but not by enough (+0.26%). It is the likely successor once tuned.
- **Simplicity Wins**: Simple linear models with good features (`opponent_adjusted_v1`) are hard to beat significantly without heavy tuning.
- **Tooling Fix**: `train.py` required updates to handle non-joblib model artifacts (JSON/CBM).

## 3. Next Steps

- **Phase 4 (Portfolio/Ensemble)**: Combine Linear and XGBoost?
- **Fine Tuning**: Run a hyperparameter sweep on XGBoost to squeeze out the missing 1.2%.
