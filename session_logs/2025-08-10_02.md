branch: feature/docs-md013
task: [IMPL-task:docs-storage-pivot] - Align docs with local Parquet backend, Python 3.12+, fix MD013
---

## Wins

- Updated docs to reflect pivot from Supabase to local Parquet storage (partitioned + manifests)
- Standardized Python baseline to 3.12+ and clarified uv-based workflow
- Resolved MD013 line-length warnings in `docs/planning/roadmap.md` by compressing tables
- Added Storage Backend section to `README.md` and deprecated Supabase section in `initial_prompt`

## Blockers

- Codebase still contains Supabase references in ingestion modules and scripts
  - `scripts/ingest_drives.py`, `scripts/ingest_plays.py`
  - `src/cfb_model/data/ingestion/*` modules reference Supabase tables
- Known indentation bug in `scripts/ingest_plays.py` remains to be fixed

## Artifacts & Links

- Docs updated:
  - `docs/planning/roadmap.md`
  - `docs/planning/initial_prompt.md`
  - `docs/cfbd/schemas.md`
  - `README.md`
- Decisions: [PRD-decision:2025-08-10]
- Session Log: [LOG:2025-08-10]

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Documentation aligned with current architecture and standards
- Next Immediate Task: Refactor code to remove Supabase dependencies and implement local Parquet
  backend fully
- Known Issues: Indentation bug in `scripts/ingest_plays.py`; Supabase imports and calls in multiple
   modules
- Next Session Context: Begin with code refactor of ingestion scripts and modules; update
  `pyproject.toml` deps if removing Supabase; run quality checks (`uv run ruff`, `bandit`, `safety`)
