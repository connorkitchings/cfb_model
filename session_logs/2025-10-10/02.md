task: "[IMPL-task:MLOPS-01] - Begin MLOps reorientation and update documentation."
---

## Wins

- Updated the project roadmap (`docs/planning/roadmap.md`) to accurately reflect all completed work and set the next development priorities.
- Re-tuned the model's confidence thresholds after the recent addition of advanced features, identifying new optimal values (`spread_std_dev=2.0`, `total_std_dev=1.5`) to balance accuracy and bet volume.
- Began the MLOps reorientation by adding `mlflow`, `hydra-core`, `hydra-optuna-sweeper`, and `optuna` as core project dependencies.
- Created the `conf/` directory for future Hydra configurations.
- Successfully refactored the main training script (`src/cfb_model/models/train_model.py`) to integrate MLflow for experiment tracking, using nested runs to log parameters, metrics, and artifacts for each model in the ensemble.
- Updated all relevant documentation (`decision_log.md`, `kb_overview.md`, and framework guides) to reflect these changes.

## Blockers

- The initial health check failed due to a dependency conflict I introduced between `optuna` and `hydra-optuna-sweeper`. This was resolved by downgrading the `optuna` version in `pyproject.toml`.
- A second health check failed due to a `NameError` and a missing docstring in the refactored training script. Both issues were fixed.

## Artifacts & Links

- **Decisions**: `[PRD-decision:2025-10-10]` (MLOps Reorientation), `[PRD-decision:2025-10-10]` (Confidence Thresholds)
- **Knowledge Base**: `[KB:MLflowNestedRuns]`
- **Code**: `src/cfb_model/models/train_model.py`, `pyproject.toml`
- **Docs**: `docs/planning/roadmap.md`, `docs/guides/scikit-learn_guide.md`, `docs/guides/PyTorch_guide.md`, `docs/guides/Tensorflow_guide.md`, `docs/guides/MLOps_Integration_Guide.md`

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point**: The first phase of the MLOps integration (MLflow) is complete and the codebase is stable and passes all health checks.
- **Next Immediate Task**: Continue the MLOps integration by refactoring the training script to use **Hydra** for configuration management, replacing `argparse` with `.yaml` configuration files.
- **Known Issues**: None.
