task: [IMPL-task:32, IMPL-task:33] - Implement Advanced Features (Rushing Analytics and Situational Efficiency)
---

## Wins

- Implemented `third_down_conversion_rate` feature, as other requested advanced rushing analytics were already present.
- Integrated the new feature into the full aggregation pipeline (`team-game` -> `team-season` -> `opponent-adjusted`).
- Fixed all test failures that arose from the new feature implementation, including data errors in test cases and indentation issues.
- Successfully retrained the ensemble models with the updated feature set.
- Updated the project documentation (`decision_log.md`, `feature_catalog.md`, `feature_engineering_plan.md`) to reflect the changes.

## Blockers

- The initial model evaluation after adding the new feature showed a significant drop in the number of bets placed, which was traced back to an increase in the variance of the model's predictions.
- Several `IndentationError` and `KeyError` issues were encountered during development, requiring careful debugging of the data pipeline and test cases.

## Artifacts & Links

- Decisions: `[PRD-decision:2025-10-10]`
- Code Health: All checks passed (Ruff format, Ruff check, Pytest, MkDocs build).

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point:** The advanced features have been implemented, and the documentation has been updated. The codebase is in a clean and stable state.
- **Next Immediate Task:** The confidence thresholds (`--spread-std-dev-threshold` and `--total-std-dev-threshold`) may need to be re-tuned to account for the higher variance of the new model and increase the number of bets placed.
- **Known Issues:** None.
