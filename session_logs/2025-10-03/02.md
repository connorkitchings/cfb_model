task: Email Template Improvements - Spread Display Logic and Betting Reasons
---

## Wins

- Fixed spread prediction display logic to match betting line conventions (negated home team margin so positive predictions show as negative spreads, e.g., South Florida wins by 10.46 â†’ "South Florida -10.46")
- Added "Line:" prefix to Best Bet box for clarity
- Ensured all spread predictions display with guaranteed +/- signs using `%+.2f` format
- Removed home team name from Total model predictions (cleaner display)
- Implemented comprehensive no-bet reason display logic in Full Schedule table (shows "No Bet - Edge below threshold" instead of just "No Bet")
- Successfully sent updated production emails to all recipients with improved formatting
- Fixed linting issues (6 auto-fixable errors resolved with ruff)

## Blockers

- None encountered during this session
- Note: Test suite has import errors (ModuleNotFoundError for cfb_model) but this is a known environment issue, not related to our changes
- mkdocs not available in current environment (minor; documentation changes were not made)

## Artifacts & Links

- Modified Files:
  - `templates/email_weekly_picks.html` - Updated spread display logic (negation), removed home team from totals, added "Line:" prefix
  - `scripts/publish_picks.py` - Enhanced no-bet reason inference logic with edge threshold checks
- Production Emails Sent:
  - Test emails sent to verify changes at multiple stages
  - Final production email sent with subject "Updated: CK's CFB Picks: 2025 Week 6"
  - Recipients: connor.kitchings@gmail.com, Rtgould@gmail.com, tap78203@gmail.com, willhair56@gmail.com
- Code Health:
  - Ruff formatting: 3 files reformatted, 45 unchanged
  - Ruff linting: 6 errors auto-fixed (unused imports, import sorting, whitespace)

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point:** All email template improvements completed and production email sent successfully. Code is formatted and linted. Template now correctly displays:
  - Spread predictions in betting line format (negative for favorites)
  - Home team name prefixed to spreads but not totals
  - "Line:" prefix in Best Bet box
  - Full no-bet explanations in all tables
  
- **Next Immediate Task:** No immediate follow-up needed. Email template is production-ready for Week 7.

- **Known Issues:** 
  - Test imports failing (pre-existing environment issue, not related to changes)
  - Consider adding test coverage for email template rendering logic in future

- **Next Session Context:** 
  - Email publishing workflow is now complete and validated
  - Template changes are backward compatible (only display logic changed, not data structure)
  - Future sessions can focus on model improvements or weekly pipeline automation
