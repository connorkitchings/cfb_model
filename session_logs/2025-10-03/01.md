task: "[IMPL-task:16] - Implement Publisher Model for Email Reports"
---

## Wins

- Successfully pivoted from a web UI to a more secure, robust email-based "Publisher Model" to accommodate local data storage.
- Created and debugged the new `scripts/publish_picks.py` script, which formats and sends the weekly report.
- Enhanced the report to include clear, specific reasons for "No Bet" decisions, improving the output's clarity.
- Resolved a complex data dependency chain by ingesting and processing all necessary raw, processed, and cached data for the 2025 season.

## Blockers

- The initial Streamlit deployment plan was incompatible with the project's local data storage constraints.
- The data pipeline failed repeatedly due to missing dependencies (raw plays, processed team_game data, and cached weekly stats).
- The email script failed due to Google's SMTP authentication requirements (App Password vs. regular password), which required creating a special diagnostic script to resolve.

## Artifacts & Links

- New Pattern: `[KB:IsolateWithDiagnosticScript]` (to be added).
- Updated Docs: `docs/operations/production_deployment.md`, `docs/operations/weekly_pipeline.md`, `docs/planning/roadmap.md`.

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point:** The new email publisher workflow is fully implemented, documented, and tested. The final formatted email for 2025 Week 5 was successfully sent.
- **Next Immediate Task:** Configure a local `cron` job to automate the weekly execution of the data pipeline and the new publisher script (`Task ID 21`).
- **Known Issues:** The `generate_weekly_bets_clean.py` script produces several non-critical `SettingWithCopyWarning` messages from pandas that could be addressed in the future.
