task: Orientation â€” context review and planning

## Outcomes
- Read onboarding docs (charter, roadmap, modeling baseline, feature catalog, betting policy, weekly pipeline, decision log) plus anchor code modules to confirm architecture, data flow, and tooling.
- Reviewed session logs from 2025-10-20 through 2025-10-22 to capture the latest progress on Hydra/Optuna work, adjustment-iteration caching, points-for experimentation, and weekly operations.
- Synthesized an initial action plan that stitches together outstanding modeling, MLOps, and operational follow-ups highlighted in recent sessions.

## Blockers
- None observed; pending items require sequencing and stakeholder alignment rather than troubleshooting.

## Next Steps
- Finalize and implement the mixed-depth weekly feature loader (separate offense/defense adjustment iterations) and update downstream consumers plus docs once behavior is validated.
- Run the planned uniform-depth adjustment sweeps, log ensemble vs single-model metrics, and revisit betting thresholds using the refreshed caches.
- Resume Hydra/Optuna sweeps with the stabilized configs, promote any improved defaults, and reconcile MLflow experiments with the points-for initiative.
- Advance points-for modeling by calibrating variance estimates, documenting findings, and deciding on rollout or continued incubation.
- Coordinate the upcoming weekly pipeline cadence (data ingest, cache refresh, predictions, scoring) so operational artifacts stay current while experimentation continues.
