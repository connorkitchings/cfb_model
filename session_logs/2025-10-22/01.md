task: [IMPL-task:MLOPS-HYDRA] - Re-enable Optuna sweeps & promote tuned defaults
---

## Wins

- Refactored Hydra defaults so Optuna search spaces live under `conf/hydra/sweeper/params/`, enabling per-model overrides without duplicating sweep specs in `conf/model/*.yaml`.
- Reran the spread elastic-net sweep with continuous domains (`tag(log, interval(...))`/`interval(...)`), capturing tuned params (`alpha≈0.0213`, `l1_ratio≈0.875`, RMSE≈17.999) in `artifacts/outputs/2025-10-22/optimization_results.yaml`.
- Smoke-tested the totals random-forest sweep path (`model=total_random_forest`, `hydra/sweeper/params=total_random_forest`, `n_trials=2`) and promoted the tuned spread elastic-net parameters into `conf/model/spread_elastic_net.yaml` so weekly runs inherit the improvement.
- Final health check (run via `.venv` because `uv run` panics): `ruff check .`, `ruff format .`, `pytest tests/ -v --tb=short`, and `mkdocs build --quiet` all pass.

## Blockers

- `uv run <command>` currently panics on macOS system-configuration init; workaround is activating `.venv` directly for tooling and sweeps.

## Artifacts & Links

- Refactored sweep configs: `conf/hydra/sweeper/params/`
- Elastic-net tune results: `artifacts/outputs/2025-10-22/optimization_results.yaml`
- Updated defaults: `conf/model/spread_elastic_net.yaml`
- MLflow runs: `artifacts/mlruns/825518544130582746/`

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Hydra/Optuna sweeps are functional again with tuned spread defaults in place.
- Next Immediate Task: Explore modeling impact of mixing non-adjusted vs partially adjusted (`x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`) feature sets before rolling into production.
- Known Issues: `uv run` panic persists; keep using `.venv` activation until root cause is addressed.
- Next Session Context: Prototype alternate adjustment depths (including raw caches) in training/evaluation scripts and document findings for a potential policy change.
