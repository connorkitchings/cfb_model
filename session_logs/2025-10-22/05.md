task: Adjustment iteration sweeps & threshold check
---

## Outcomes

- Extended weekly loaders and consumers to support mixed offense/defense adjustment depths (Hydra keys + CLI flags) and documented the new controls.
- Ran uniform-depth sweeps (iterations 0â€“4) with 5-trial Optuna searches for spread elastic net and total random forest; executed full walk-forward validation for each depth.
- Captured per-iteration metrics in `artifacts/reports/metrics/adjustment_iteration/metrics_iteration_*.csv` and assembled an aggregate summary (`overall_metrics_summary.csv`).
- Uniform-depth analysis shows spread ensemble RMSE lowest at iteration 0 (18.41) with negligible variance across depths; totals best_single random forest varies by <0.04 RMSE across depths (minimum at iteration 3).
- Based on marginal differences and existing variance filters, recommend holding current 6.0 edge thresholds and std-dev gates pending a bet-level hit-rate review.

## Blockers

- Walk-forward validation remains time-intensive (~15 minutes per depth); consider caching per-iteration predictions if additional analyses are required.

## Next Steps

- Evaluate mixed offense/defense configurations using the new loader, focusing on (off=0/def=2) and (off=1/def=3) combinations to test smoothing asymmetry.
- Run bet-level simulations against sportsbook lines to validate whether the current 6-point edge threshold and std-dev filters remain optimal under the chosen iteration depth.
- Promote chosen iteration defaults (likely offense=0/def=3 or status quo) once mixed-depth experiments and bet-level analysis converge.
