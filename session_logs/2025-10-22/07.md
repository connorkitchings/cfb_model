branch: main
task: Session wrap — mixed-depth sweeps & points-for comparison
---

## Wins

- Added mixed-depth cache support across loaders/CLIs and documented that offense=1 / defense=3 trims totals RMSE while spreads stay flat; kept the production default at 4/4.
- Ran uniform and asymmetric iteration sweeps plus edge-threshold analyses; stored results under `artifacts/reports/metrics/adjustment_iteration/` and `artifacts/reports/metrics/threshold_analysis/`.
- Trained fresh points-for models, regenerated 2024 predictions for comparison-only mode, and captured their threshold curves alongside the legacy ensemble.

## Blockers

- Week 1 caches are missing for non-4/4 combos; sweeps currently cover weeks 2–15 only.

## Artifacts & Links

- Iteration metrics: `artifacts/reports/metrics/adjustment_iteration/overall_metrics_summary.csv`
- Edge sweeps (legacy / points-for): `artifacts/reports/metrics/threshold_analysis/`
- Points-for models & stats: `artifacts/models/points_for_off1_def3/2024/`
- Session summary updates: `docs/planning/adjustment_iteration_experiments.md`, `docs/planning/points_for_model.md`

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Mixed-depth evaluation complete; 4/4 remains the active default with documented rationale.
- Next Immediate Task: Decide on updated edge thresholds (spread 7–8, totals ≥8) and backtest across 2023–2024 before codifying.
- Known Issues: Week 1 caches absent for alternative iteration combos; points-for spreads underperform legacy ensemble.
- Next Session Context: Calibrate/tune points-for (variance + feature pruning) while preparing a 2023–2024 ROI analysis for the candidate thresholds and iteration depths.
