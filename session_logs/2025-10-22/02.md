task: Orientation — adjusted vs unadjusted feature exploration
---

## Summary

- Reviewed core docs (charter, roadmap, modeling baseline, feature catalog, betting policy, weekly pipeline) and recent session logs (2025-10-20 → 2025-10-22) to refresh modeling context and in-flight priorities.
- Implemented iteration-specific storage for weekly adjusted stats (`processed/team_week_adj/iteration=<n>/year=/week=`) and plumbed the new selector through cache writers, loaders, training/validation scripts, and the weekly generator; rebuilt 2019, 2021–2025 caches at depths 0–4 and removed the legacy `team_week_adj/year=*` layout.
- Exposed CLI/Hydra knobs so analysts can request alternative adjustment depths without code edits; default behavior continues to use four iterations for backward compatibility.
- Updated documentation to reflect the new directory layout and attempted `uv run ruff check` (panic persists; recommend invoking `ruff` via the virtualenv until the known issue is resolved).

## Next Steps

- Rebuild weekly caches with the desired iteration depths (e.g., `--adjustment-iterations 0,1,2,3,4`) and verify downstream scripts locate the new partitions.
- Benchmark 0–3 iteration variants against the fully adjusted baseline using the refreshed walk-forward tooling once data extracts are ready.
- Capture experiment outcomes for the points-for initiative and update docs/decision log if policy shifts are recommended.
