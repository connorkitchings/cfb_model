branch: [no-git-changes]
task: [IMPL-ingest-schema-docs] - Extract and document all relevant CFBD API schemas for database design
---

## Wins

- Resolved all environment and dependency issues (uv.lock, pyproject.toml, Python version)
- Successfully authenticated with the CollegeFootballData API and tested connectivity
- Extended and executed the ingestion script to extract schemas for all major endpoints: games,
  plays, drives, betting lines, team info, roster info, advanced stats, and coaches
- Documented all discovered schemas in `docs/cfbd/schemas.md` for use in Supabase table design

## Blockers

- The installed cfbd-python version (5.9.1) does not support metrics, ratings, or recruiting
  endpoints; these schemas could not be extracted or documented
- Team talent endpoint is missing from this version as well

## Artifacts & Links

- Schemas: [docs/cfbd/schemas.md]
- Session Plan: [LOG:2025-08-03]
- Previous Log: [LOG:2025-08-02]

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: All available schemas have been extracted and documented; environment is healthy
  and ready for further ingestion or modeling work
- Next Immediate Task: Design Supabase tables based on the documented schemas in
  `docs/cfbd/schemas.md`
- Known Issues: Metrics, ratings, and recruiting endpoints unavailable in cfbd-python 5.9.1;
  revisit if upgrading the package
- Next Session Context: Begin database design, or upgrade cfbd-python and re-extract advanced
  schemas if needed
