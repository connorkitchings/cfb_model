task: "[DS-VAL-01] - Validate Points-For Model via Multi-Year Walk-Forward"
---

## Wins

- Successfully ran a multi-year (2019-2024) walk-forward validation for the Points-For CatBoost model architecture after resolving several complex Hydra configuration issues.
- Correctly identified that the Points-For model, while promising, is not consistently profitable across multiple seasons (~51.4% spread hit rate vs 52.4% required).
- Updated the project's official `decision_log.md` to reflect these findings, rolling back a premature decision to productionize the model and ensuring the project maintains a high standard for model validation.
- Created a reusable analysis script (`scripts/create_walk_forward_report.py`) for generating detailed betting performance reports from walk-forward validation outputs.

## Blockers

- The session was significantly delayed by a series of cascading Hydra configuration errors, which required a deep dive into Hydra's composition logic and a refactoring of the `paths` configuration to resolve.

## Artifacts & Links

- Decisions: `docs/decisions/decision_log.md` (entry for 2025-11-24)
- Reports: `artifacts/reports/walk_forward_summary.md`
- Code: `scripts/walk_forward_validation.py`, `scripts/create_walk_forward_report.py`

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point:** The walk-forward validation is complete, and the results have been analyzed and documented. The project now has a clear and realistic understanding of the current Points-For model's performance.
- **Next Immediate Task:** Re-evaluate the Points-For modeling strategy. The next steps should focus on either more advanced feature engineering or exploring different model architectures (e.g., a mixed CatBoost/XGBoost ensemble) to improve the model's predictive edge.
- **Known Issues:** The `ruff check` command still reports numerous non-blocking style errors (E402, N806). These have been ignored for this session as per the project guidelines but should be addressed in a future refactoring-focused session. Pytest is passing after a minor fix.
- **Next Session Context:** The primary data science goal is to find a way to increase the Points-For model's hit rate above the 52.4% profitability threshold, now using the multi-year walk-forward validation framework as the definitive test.
