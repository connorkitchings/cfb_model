## Wins

- ✅ Successfully executed walk-forward validation for 2025 season (827 games across weeks 3-13)
- ✅ Analyzed calibration metrics: RMSE 17.95, Bias -1.21 (consistent with historical performance)
- ✅ Calculated directional accuracy: 66.26% winner prediction rate (548/827 games)
- ✅ Generated comprehensive 2025 performance report with historical comparison
- ✅ Discovered existing betting lines data (2023-2025) on external drive
- ✅ Created revised betting line integration plan focused on joining existing data

## Blockers

- Linter shows 66 errors (mostly E402 module imports, N806 variable naming in research scripts)
  - These are primarily in experimental/research scripts, not production code
  - `scripts/calculate_2025_betting_metrics.py` has import ordering issues but is functional
- Missing betting lines for 2019, 2021-2022 (user mentioned CFBD has these, may need to backfill)

## Artifacts & Links

- **2025 Predictions**: `artifacts/validation/walk_forward/2025_predictions.csv` (827 games)
- **Calibration Report**: `artifacts/reports/calibration/calibration_2025_predictions.png`
- **Performance Report**: `artifacts/reports/2025_performance_report.md`
- **Betting Metrics CSV**: `artifacts/reports/2025_betting_metrics.csv`
- **Walkthrough**: `walkthrough.md` (session summary)
- **Integration Plan**: `docs/plans/betting_line_integration.md`

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point**: Completed 2025 season prediction analysis and created betting line integration plan. Discovered that betting lines data for 2023-2025 already exists at `/Volumes/CK SSD/Coding Projects/cfb_model/raw/betting_lines/` with CSVs partitioned by year/week containing spread, over_under, opening lines, and multiple sportsbook providers.

- **Next Immediate Task**: Implement betting line integration following `docs/plans/betting_line_integration.md`:

  1. Create `scripts/analysis/load_betting_lines.py` to read CSVs and aggregate consensus lines
  2. Join betting lines with existing 2023-2025 predictions
  3. Calculate true ATS hit rates and ROI metrics

- **Known Issues**:

  - Linter errors in research scripts (non-blocking for production)
  - Need to decide whether to backfill 2019, 2021-2022 betting lines before proceeding or start with 2023-2025 first

- **Next Session Context**: User chose Option A - start with 2023-2025 betting line analysis now, backfill earlier years if needed later. The integration plan is approved and ready for implementation. Data structure confirmed: CSV files with columns for `spread`, `spread_open`, `over_under`, `over_under_open`, `provider` (DraftKings, Bovada, etc.).
