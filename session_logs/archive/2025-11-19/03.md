task: [IMPL-task:MODEL-DEV] - Promote totals model and prototype new spread model target
---

## Wins

- Successfully promoted the `cfb_total_catboost` model to "Production" in the MLflow Model Registry after debugging the connection to the MLflow server.
- Prototyped a new "points-for" spread modeling approach by training separate Ridge regression models for home and away scores.
- Documented the experimental results and the decision to pause further development on this specific prototype in `docs/decisions/decision_log.md`.

## Blockers

- Initial difficulty connecting to the MLflow server, which was resolved by starting the Docker container and setting the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` environment variable.
- Discrepancy between session logs and the MLflow registry state required debugging and a workaround to re-register the model from its run ID.

## Artifacts & Links

- Decisions: `docs/decisions/decision_log.md`
- Code Health:
  - `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format .` passed.
  - `uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short` passed (45 passed).
  - `uv run mkdocs build --quiet` passed.

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: The "points-for" prototype has been evaluated and the results documented. The codebase has been cleaned of temporary scripts.
- Next Immediate Task: Revisit spread model improvement, possibly by exploring different feature engineering techniques or alternative model architectures, as the "points-for" prototype did not outperform the baseline.
- Known Issues: None.
- Next Session Context: The `cfb_total_catboost` model is now the production model for totals. The spread model remains the existing ensemble. The next session should focus on improving the spread model.
