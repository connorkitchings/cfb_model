task: [IMPL-task:MODEL-VALIDATION] - Registry walk-forward validation & docs update
---

# TL;DR (≤5 lines)
- Hardened MLflow tracking paths and registered CatBoost totals + LightGBM spreads as staging models.
- Ran walk-forward validation slices (weeks 6-13) over 2019-2024, confirming CatBoost totals match baseline while spreads still trail.
- Updated model evaluation docs/decision log with metrics tables and saved artifacts under `artifacts/validation/walk_forward/`.
- Added week-range/year overrides + email dry-run capability to support upcoming week-14 ops.

**tags:** ["modeling","validation","mlflow","docs","ops"]

## Wins

- Added `walk_forward.start_week/end_week/years` and centralized MLflow URI resolution so WFV runs stay manageable and always log to `artifacts/mlruns/`.
- Registered `cfb_total_catboost` v1 and `cfb_spread_lightgbm` v1 with `staging` aliases, then validated them over multiple seasons; metrics show CatBoost totals within 0.17 RMSE of the ensemble while LightGBM spreads still lag by ~0.7 RMSE.
- Documented the findings in `docs/project_org/model_evaluation_criteria.md` and `docs/decisions/decision_log.md`, preserving both per-season CSVs and averaged summaries for future reference.
- Added `--dry-run` support to `scripts/publish_review.py` so we can preview week-14 emails without SMTP credentials.

## Blockers

- Full 2019-2024 WFV still takes ~10 minutes with noisy verbose output; we split runs into smaller year groups as a workaround. Need to quiet the logging or chunk years further for regular use.

## Artifacts & Links

- Registry models: `cfb_total_catboost@staging` (run `fc930a8e...`), `cfb_spread_lightgbm@staging` (run `971c8a...`).
- Validation outputs: `artifacts/validation/walk_forward/metrics_summary_{2019_2021,2022_2024}.csv`, `.../metrics_summary_2019_2024_avg.csv`.
- Docs: `docs/project_org/model_evaluation_criteria.md`, `docs/decisions/decision_log.md`.

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Registry staging models validated on weeks 6-13 for 2019-2024, docs updated, tooling ready for week-14 ops.
- Next Immediate Task: Run the weekly pipeline once week-14 data lands (refresh caches, generate/scored reports, publish review email via `--dry-run` first).
- Known Issues: WFV is still noisy/slow for the full horizon; consider reducing logging or parallelizing future runs.
- Next Session Context: Start from the staging models + documentation; focus on week-14 ingestion/prediction and revisit LightGBM spread tuning (exponential weights/mixed adjustment depths).
