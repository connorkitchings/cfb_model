task: [IMPL-task:MODEL-DEV] - Week-14 ingestion, feature engineering & modeling sweeps
---

# TL;DR (≤5 lines)
- Ingested weeks 13–14 data, rebuilt caches, and generated the week-14 prediction slate (14 spread / 12 total plays, 5% exposure).
- Extended feature engineering with drive/field-position metrics + feature-pack controls, added cache profiler, and documented future modeling ideas.
- Ran LightGBM + CatBoost sweeps with curated packs/variance filters; WFV shows totals ready for promotion while spreads still trail the ensemble.
- Captured new MLflow experiments (`CFB_LightGBM_FeaturePacks`, `CFB_CatBoost_FeaturePacks`) and refreshed WFV artifacts under `artifacts/validation/walk_forward/`.

**tags:** ["dataops","features","modeling","validation","docs"]

## Wins

- Pulled weeks 13–14 games/plays/lines, refreshed running/adjusted caches, and produced `artifacts/reports/2025/predictions/CFB_week14_bets.csv` + metadata (`2.5` units spread risk, `0` totals until lines finalize).
- Added offensive/defensive points-per-drive + field-position deltas, feature-pack filtering, variance thresholds, and the cache profiler CLI; updated `docs/project_org/modeling_baseline.md` with upcoming experiment notes.
- Ran new LightGBM sweeps (including asymmetric adjustment depths) with feature packs logged to MLflow; re-used the same controls for CatBoost sweeps.
- Rebuilt walk-forward validation summaries using the best-single LightGBM/CatBoost strategies so we can compare against the ensemble on 2023–2024.

## Blockers

- LightGBM and CatBoost spreads still underperform the ensemble by ~0.5–1.0 RMSE despite feature-pack tuning; spread promotion remains blocked until modeling strategy changes (e.g., power ratings or different targets).

## Artifacts & Links

- Week-14 predictions: `artifacts/reports/2025/predictions/CFB_week14_bets.csv` and metadata JSON.
- MLflow experiments: `CFB_LightGBM_FeaturePacks` & `CFB_CatBoost_FeaturePacks` under `artifacts/mlruns/` (top runs `74959a40...`, `68cb5c89...`).
- WFV outputs: `artifacts/validation/walk_forward/metrics_summary_{2023,2024,overall}.csv` (strategy rows show LightGBM/CatBoost gaps vs. ensemble).
- Docs updated: `docs/project_org/modeling_baseline.md` (Future Research ideas).

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Week-14 slate generated, feature engineering upgrades merged, LightGBM/CatBoost sweeps logged, and WFV summaries refreshed.
- Next Immediate Task: Explore alternative spread targets (raw-offense vs. adjusted-defense, probabilistic power ratings) and re-run sweeps once new targets are ready.
- Known Issues: Non-linear spread models still lag baseline; LightGBM/CatBoost training emits many “no further splits” warnings due to limited signal.
- Next Session Context: Start from the new experiments logged in MLflow, prototype the raw-vs-adjusted offensive target for points-for, and draft the probabilistic power-ratings modeling plan before the next WFV cycle.
