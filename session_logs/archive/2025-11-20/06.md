task: [IMPL-task:MODEL-VALIDATION] - Feature cache spot-check and spread model recap
---

## Wins

- Ran `scripts/debug_feature_pipeline.py` across 2019, 2021-2025 caches (iteration=4) with data_root `/Volumes/CK SSD/Coding Projects/cfb_model`; confirmed no NaN/inf in 2023-2025 and isolated remaining NaNs to a few special-teams net-punt recency columns in 2019-2022 plus rare single-row trench splits in 2021.
- Computed CatBoost spread metrics over full horizon (2019, 2021-2025) from `artifacts/validation/walk_forward/combined_predictions_catboost.csv`; overall RMSE 18.51 / MAE 14.54 with per-season RMSE 19.91 (2019) down to 17.90 (2025), establishing CatBoost as current leader.

## Blockers

- Residual NaNs in `off_avg_net_punt_yards_last_{1,2,3}` for early seasons; need recency fill/clip to fully clean caches.
- No unified single-run WFV covering 2019 & 2021-2025 yet; current metrics stitched from banded runs.

## Artifacts & Links

- Feature checks: `scripts/debug_feature_pipeline.py` outputs (CLI)
- Metrics: `artifacts/validation/walk_forward/combined_predictions_catboost.csv` (spread predictions & metrics over horizon)
- Decision context: CatBoost + `core_spread` pack remains preferred spread model pending cache cleanups

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Diagnostics completed; feature caches clean for 2023-2025, minor ST/trench NaNs remain in 2019-2022; CatBoost spread metrics summarized.
- Next Immediate Task: Add fillna(0) + optional ~65-yard cap for `off_avg_net_punt_yards*` (and trench recency splits) in recency aggregation, rebuild 2019/2021/2022 caches (iteration=4), then rerun a single CatBoost-only WFV across 2019 & 2021-2025.
- Known Issues: LightGBM still noisy (“no further splits”); special-teams net-punt recency NaNs in early years.
- Next Session Context: Focus on cache rebuild + unified CatBoost WFV/metrics and update decision log once clean run is logged.
