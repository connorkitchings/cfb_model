task: [IMPL-task:EMAIL-REFINEMENT] - Refine and debug the weekly betting email template.
---

## Wins

- Corrected the `consider_moneyline` logic to properly identify potential upset scenarios.
- Fixed multiple layout and rendering issues with team logos, ensuring they appear correctly and consistently across all tables.
- Improved the date/time display by combining them into a single column and adding a date range to the email title.
- Simplified the "Full Schedule" table by removing the "Edge" columns to save space.
- Added the full weekly bets CSV as an attachment to the email.
- Resolved several persistent linting errors in `scripts/publish_picks.py`.

## Blockers

- A `jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError` occurred because the template was referencing ROI data that was no longer being provided.
- The `replace` tool's limitation of single occurrences caused initial failures when trying to update multiple identical HTML sections.
- The email template had a corrupted `<tbody>` section that required manual reconstruction.
- Persistent email client rendering issues required multiple layout adjustments and debugging attempts to resolve the logo display problems.
- A persistent `ruff` import sorting error required multiple attempts to fix, ultimately resolved with `ruff check --fix`.

## Artifacts & Links

- **Code Health:** All checks passed (ruff format, ruff check, pytest, mkdocs build).
- **Modified Files:**
  - `scripts/publish_picks.py`
  - `templates/email_weekly_picks.html`

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point:** The weekly betting email is now feature-complete and visually polished. All requested changes have been implemented and verified. The codebase is clean and passes all health checks.
- **Next Immediate Task:** The email generation system is stable. The next logical step is to return to the model improvement backlog, such as experimenting with alternative models (e.g., XGBoost) or implementing more advanced features.
- **Known Issues:** None.
