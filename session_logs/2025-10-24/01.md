task: [IMPL-task:XGBOOST-TUNING] - Tune and benchmark XGBoost for points-for model.
---

## Summary

This session focused on tuning and benchmarking the XGBoost model for the points-for prediction task. We addressed a configuration issue, successfully ran hyperparameter optimization, and performed a walk-forward validation to evaluate its performance.

## Wins

- Successfully identified and corrected a configuration error (`slice_path` was null) that prevented the XGBoost hyperparameter optimization script from running.
- Reran the XGBoost hyperparameter optimization script, which completed successfully.
- Manually identified the best-performing hyperparameters for the XGBoost model from the MLflow artifacts.
- Updated the `conf/model/points_for_xgboost.yaml` file with the optimal hyperparameters.
- Successfully ran the walk-forward validation script, generating performance metrics for the tuned XGBoost model and other models across multiple seasons.

## Blockers

- The MLflow UI did not display the "CFB_Model_Hyperparameter_Tuning" experiment, even after the script ran successfully. This required manual inspection of the `artifacts/mlruns` directory to find the best run.
- The `uv run` command still panics on macOS, requiring the use of `source .venv/bin/activate` as a workaround.

## Learnings

- When the MLflow UI is not reflecting the experiments, direct inspection of the `artifacts/mlruns` directory and its `meta.yaml` files can help locate the runs.
- The `optimize_hyperparameters.py` script for points-for models requires `data.slice_path`, `data.train_weeks`, and `data.test_weeks` to be correctly configured in `conf/config.yaml`.

## Next Steps

- **Immediate Next Task:** Analyze the `metrics_summary.csv` to compare the performance of the tuned XGBoost "points-for" model against the legacy ensemble, especially for "totals" predictions. Based on this analysis, decide whether to adopt the XGBoost model for totals.

## Final Health Check

- `uv run ruff check .`: ✅
- `uv run ruff format .`: ✅
- `uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short`: ✅
- `uv run mkdocs build --quiet`: ✅
