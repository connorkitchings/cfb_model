task: [IMPL-task:MLOPS-SWEEPS] - Refresh hyperparameter sweeps and walk-forward validation
---

## Wins

- Re-ran Optuna sweep for `spread_elastic_net`; confirmed prior best params (α≈0.0213, l1≈0.875) remain optimal (MLflow run `9833340e9908465184524f1f1e28998e`).
- Executed fresh sweeps for totals random forest and points-for XGBoost, updating `conf/model/points_for_xgboost.yaml` to the latest best-performing configuration (n_estimators=500, learning_rate≈0.0149, depth=3, subsample≈0.818, colsample_bytree≈0.983).
- Completed full walk-forward validation with the new points-for defaults; archived per-season predictions and the aggregated metrics summary in `artifacts/validation/walk_forward/`.

## Blockers

- `ruff check` fails in pre-existing analysis modules (`scripts/analysis_cli.py`, `src/analysis/unadjusted.py`, and `tests/test_unadjusted_analysis.py`) due to import ordering and E402 issues; untouched during this session.
- Two unadjusted-analysis tests require writable raw/processed directories under the tmp path; `LocalStorage` now errors when those directories are absent, so the test harness needs to provision them before calling the helper.

## Artifacts & Links

- Sweep summary CSV: `artifacts/reports/metrics/hyperparameter_sweeps/latest_summary.csv`
- Walk-forward predictions: `artifacts/validation/walk_forward/{2019,2021,2022,2023,2024}_predictions.csv`
- Aggregated walk-forward metrics: `artifacts/validation/walk_forward/metrics_summary.csv`

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Hyperparameter sweeps refreshed; walk-forward validation finished with legacy totals still outperforming points-for.
- Next Immediate Task: Tackle points-for variance calibration/feature pruning before another validation pass to see if totals can surpass the legacy ensemble.
- Known Issues: Lint and test failures noted above; `walk_forward_validation.py` runtime (~23 minutes) can exceed CLI timeouts when run end-to-end.
- Next Session Context: Focus on points-for modeling improvements first, then revisit adjustment-depth/threshold analysis once calibration work is in place.
