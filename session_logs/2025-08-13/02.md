branch: main
task: IMPL-task:11-preagg - Pre-aggregation persistence + CLI wiring
---

## Wins

- Added robust pre-aggregation persistence helpers in `src/cfb_model/features/play_features.py`:
  - `persist_preaggregations(...)` to write byplay/drives/team_game/team_season to `processed/`.
  - `persist_byplay_only(...)` to isolate playsâ†’byplay transformation.
- Hardened `allplays_to_byplay(...)` and time features for real-world data:
  - Coerced key sort/group columns (`season`, `week`, `game_id`, `quarter`, `play_number`) to ints.
  - Sanitized numeric fields; NaN-safe duration calculation with context masking.
- Made local storage resilient to schema variability:
  - Implemented full `LocalParquetStorage.write/read_index`.
  - Added per-file read with partition-derived `week` to avoid Arrow dictionary merge errors.
- CLI updates in `scripts/ingest_cli.py`:
  - New `preagg` command (full set) and `byplay` command (byplay-only).
  - Auto-load `.env` so paths with spaces in `CFB_MODEL_DATA_ROOT` work.
- Successfully generated 2024 byplay dataset: wrote 125,014 rows to `processed/byplay/season=2024/...`.

## Blockers

- Some raw partitions have Arrow schema inconsistencies (`week` typed as dictionary); mitigated with
  per-file reads and partition-derived `week`.
- Residual data-quality quirks (negative/zero durations) observed; now masked and logged.

## Artifacts & Links

- Code: `src/cfb_model/features/play_features.py`
  - New: `persist_preaggregations`, `persist_byplay_only`; updates to `allplays_to_byplay`, `calculate_time_features`.
- Storage: `src/cfb_model/data/storage/local_parquet.py`
  - Completed `LocalParquetStorage` read/write; robust per-file index reading.
- CLI: `scripts/ingest_cli.py`
  - Added `preagg` and `byplay` subcommands; `.env` loading.
- Output: `processed/byplay/season=2024/` (125,014 rows written)

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Byplay successfully written for 2024; end-to-end pre-aggregation wired with
  resilient storage and CLI.
- Next Immediate Task: Extend to full pre-aggregations by enabling drives/team_game/team_season
  write (now that byplay is validated). Then sample-validate a week.
- Known Issues: Some partitions still unreadable individually; reader skips with log. Consider a
  cleanup script to re-materialize or coerce problematic files.
- Next Session Context: Run `preagg` for 2024; inspect `processed/drives` and aggregation outputs;
  begin unit tests for feature calculations and storage layout.
