task: IMPL-task:11-preagg - Pre-aggregation pipeline + processed storage + docs
---

## Wins

- Implemented pre-aggregation in `src/cfb_model/features/play_features.py`:
  - `assign_drive_numbers`, `aggregate_drives`, `aggregate_team_game`,
    `aggregate_team_season`, `build_preaggregation_pipeline`.
  - Correct drive play counting via `is_drive_play` (excludes ST, penalties,
    timeouts/clock, two-point tries) and drive time over counted plays only.
- Added `ProcessedParquetStorage` writing to `processed/` next to `raw_data/` in `src/cfb_model/data/storage/local_parquet.py`.
- Expanded `docs/project_org/feature_catalog.md` with plays → drives → games → season
  pre-aggregation definitions.
- Resolved markdownlint MD036 in `.vscode/.cursorrules` by converting emphasis to proper headings.
- Cleared lints on updated files.

## Blockers

- None today.

## Artifacts & Links

- Code: `src/cfb_model/features/play_features.py`
  - New/updated: `assign_drive_numbers`, `aggregate_drives`, `aggregate_team_game`,
    `aggregate_team_season`, `build_preaggregation_pipeline`, `is_drive_play` logic
- Storage: `src/cfb_model/data/storage/local_parquet.py`
  - New: `ProcessedParquetStorage` (writes to `processed/`)
- Docs: `docs/project_org/feature_catalog.md`
  - Added “Pre-aggregation pipeline (plays → drives → games → season)” section
- Lint/Rules: `.vscode/.cursorrules`
  - Fixed MD036 (no-emphasis-as-heading)

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Pre-aggregation implemented; processed storage path in place;
  docs updated.
- Next Immediate Task: Add `persist_preaggregations(...)` helper to write
  byplay/drives/team_game/team_season into `processed/` with season/week
  partitions; integrate into CLI/flow.
- Known Issues: None observed; need validation on a small data sample to verify
  drive boundaries and counts.
- Next Session Context: Validate pipeline on a week of data, generate sample
  processed outputs, then implement opponent-adjustment (iterative averaging)
  using the documented algorithm.
