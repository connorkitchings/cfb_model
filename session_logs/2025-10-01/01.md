branch: main
task: [IMPL-task:MODEL-IMPROVEMENT-ENSEMBLE] - Implement ensemble modeling and confidence-based filtering.
---

## Wins

- Implemented an ensemble modeling architecture, training multiple models for both spread (`Ridge`, `ElasticNet`, `HuberRegressor`) and total (`RandomForest`, `GradientBoosting`) predictions.
- Updated the weekly prediction pipeline to average the outputs of the ensemble models, creating a more robust prediction.
- Added a confidence filter based on the standard deviation of the ensemble's predictions, allowing for more selective and higher-quality bets.
- Ran a full 2024 season backtest with the new architecture and confidence filter (`--spread-std-dev-threshold 5.0`, `--total-std-dev-threshold 5.0`), achieving a **55.9% hit rate**.

## Blockers

- The `run-season` CLI command initially failed because it didn't recognize the new `--spread-std-dev-threshold` and `--total-std-dev-threshold` arguments. This was resolved by updating `scripts/cli.py`.

## Artifacts & Links

- Decisions: `[PRD-decision:2025-10-01]` - Ensemble Model Architecture for Variance Reduction
- Code:
  - `src/cfb_model/models/train_model.py`
  - `src/cfb_model/scripts/generate_weekly_bets_clean.py`
  - `scripts/cli.py`
- Learnings: `[KB:EnsembleConfidenceFilter]` - Using the standard deviation of predictions from an ensemble of models is an effective method for filtering out low-confidence bets and improving overall hit rate.

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point**: The ensemble modeling and confidence filtering implementation is complete and has been validated against the 2024 holdout season, showing improved performance.
- **Next Immediate Task**: Begin the next phase of model improvement by focusing on **advanced feature engineering**, starting with the implementation of **Interaction and Differential Features**.
- **Known Issues**: None. The modeling architecture is stable and performing well.
- **Next Session Context**: The model architecture has been significantly improved. The next session will focus on enhancing the features that are fed into this new architecture.
