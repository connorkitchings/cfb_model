task: [IMPL-task:FEATURE-ENGINEERING-MOMENTUM] - Implement momentum and trending features.
---

## Wins

- Implemented momentum features (`_last_3` and `_last_1` game averages) for all key metrics in the `aggregate_team_season` function.
- Updated the feature list to include these new momentum features in the modeling pipeline.
- Retrained the ensemble models with the enhanced feature set.
- Ran a full 2024 season backtest, achieving a **56.7% hit rate** (85/150), a slight improvement over the previous 55.9%.

## Blockers

- An initial run of the training script produced a `ConvergenceWarning` for the `HuberRegressor`. This was resolved by wrapping the model in a `Pipeline` with a `StandardScaler`.
- A subsequent run produced a stream-related error, which was traced back to a large print statement in the training script. This was resolved by removing the print statement.

## Artifacts & Links

- Code:
  - `src/cfb_model/data/aggregations/core.py`
  - `src/cfb_model/models/features.py`
- Learnings:
  - `[KB:ScalingForConvergence]`: For iterative models like `HuberRegressor`, scaling the data with `StandardScaler` is a good practice to ensure convergence.
  - `[KB:LargePrintsAndStreams]`: Avoid printing very large, wide DataFrames to the console in automated scripts, as it can corrupt the output stream.

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point**: The momentum features have been implemented and validated, showing a small improvement in performance. The codebase is stable and all health checks are passing.
- **Next Immediate Task**: Analyze the impact of the new momentum features in more detail (e.g., using SHAP values) to confirm they are contributing positively to the model's predictions.
- **Known Issues**: None.
- **Next Session Context**: The model has been improved with new features. The next session can focus on a deeper analysis of these features or move on to the next feature engineering idea.
