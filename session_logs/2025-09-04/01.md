task: IMPL-validation-2025-09-04 - Deep aggregation validation, schema versioning, and historical recollection
---

## Wins

- Implemented deep semantic validators spanning drives, team_game, team_season, and opponent-adjusted levels; integrated under a --deep flag.
- Added robust reads and derived columns to validation (e.g., reconstruct is_drive_play) to handle schema evolution without failures.
- Version-stamped all manifests (schema_version, data_type, entity, file_format) from LocalStorage.
- Added --quiet flag to pre-aggregation to reduce per-game logging; updated persistence layer to respect verbosity.
- Built a driver script to recollect plays and run aggregations across seasons (2014–2019, 2021–2024; skipped 2020) and executed it end-to-end.
- Spot-validated 2014, 2019, and 2024 processed outputs with deep validations — all passed with no issues.

## Blockers

- None blocking. Observed negative play_duration warnings due to CFBD clock irregularities; these are masked per design and do not affect downstream aggregates.

## Artifacts & Links

- New CLI: scripts/recollect_plays_and_aggregate.py
- Validation: src/cfb_model/data/validation.py (now supports --deep)
- Storage manifests: src/cfb_model/data/storage/local_storage.py (schema_version, entity, data_type)
- Aggregations quiet mode: scripts/aggregations_cli.py (--quiet) and src/cfb_model/data/aggregations/persist.py (verbose flag)

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Recollection and pre-aggregation complete for 2014–2019, 2021–2024; deep validations clean on spot checks (2014/2019/2024).
- Next Immediate Task: Optionally run deep validations for all years in batch; consider adding --strict-schema validator mode to enforce exact column sets now that data is uniform.
- Known Issues: None critical. CFBD clock anomalies remain handled by masking (negative durations set to NaN).
- Next Session Context: Use scripts/recollect_plays_and_aggregate.py for any future replays; run deep validator post-aggregation to sanity check.
