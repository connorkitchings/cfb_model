## 1. Session Summary

**Task Completed:** `DOCS-01` - Improve developer experience and plan for advanced features.

**Key Outcomes:**

- Updated the `publish_picks.py` script to calculate and display ROI in the weekly email report.
- Created `run_weekly_pipeline.sh` to provide a single, reusable command for executing the weekly data and betting pipeline.
- Improved the documentation and type hints in `score_weekly_picks.py` and `generate_weekly_bets_clean.py` to enhance clarity and maintainability.
- Drafted a detailed plan for **Advanced Feature Engineering** (Rushing Analytics and Situational Efficiency) and appended it to `docs/guides/feature_engineering_plan.md`.
- Authored a new guide, `docs/guides/advanced_feature_engineering_overview.md`, to provide context for future development.

## 2. Blockers and Learnings

- **Blockers Encountered:** None. The session was focused on documentation and code quality, so the disconnected external drive was not an issue.
- **New Learnings/Patterns:** The project's clear structure and use of tools like `typer` make it straightforward to understand and extend existing scripts.

## 3. Next Steps

- **Immediate Next Task:** Begin the implementation of the **Advanced Rushing Analytics** features as defined in the updated `feature_engineering_plan.md`.

## 4. Final Health Check
