task: [IMPL-task:DATA-INTEGRITY-2014] - Debug and validate the GameStatsIngester and run a full end-to-end data pipeline test for the 2014 season.
---

## Wins

- Diagnosed why the `GameStatsIngester` was inefficiently falling back to per-game calls for the 2014 season.
- Proved that the efficient, week-based `get_game_team_stats` endpoint _does_ return data for 2014, contrary to the initial hypothesis.
- Refactored the `GameStatsIngester` to remove the inefficient fallback logic, making it more robust and preventing accidental high-volume API usage.
- Fixed an inconsistency in `scripts/cli.py` where the `aggregate` command was missing the `--data-root` option.
- Successfully ran the entire data pipeline (ingestion -> aggregation) for the 2014 season.
- Cleaned up the codebase by removing a corrupted script (`generate_weekly_bets.py`) and fixing all outstanding linting issues.

## Blockers

- Initial `PermissionError` due to the external hard drive not being connected, which required user intervention.
- The `aggregate` CLI command was missing the `--data-root` argument, which was fixed.

## Artifacts & Links

- Code Health: All lint checks now pass; all 14 tests pass; docs build successfully.
- Refactored Code: `src/cfb_model/data/ingestion/game_stats.py`, `scripts/cli.py`
- Learnings: `[KB:EndpointBehaviorVerification]`, `[KB:ConsistentCliInterface]`

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point**: The data pipeline has been successfully tested end-to-end on an older season (2014), and its efficiency and robustness have been improved. The codebase is clean and passes all quality checks.
- **Next Immediate Task**: Return to model improvement, as the baseline model's performance is slightly below the profitability threshold. This involves either deeper feature engineering or experimenting with alternative models (e.g., XGBoost, as per Task 14 in the backlog).
- **Known Issues**: None. The data pipeline is stable and ready for the next phase of modeling work.
