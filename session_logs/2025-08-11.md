branch: feature/docs-md013
task: [IMPL-task:DOCS-EXEC-CHECKLIST] - Documentation reorg and readiness (Execution Checklist, CFBD 101, Feature Catalog, nav)
---

## Wins

- Added Execution Checklist with acceptance criteria to `docs/planning/roadmap.md`.
- Enhanced CFBD docs: added “CFBD 101 (Endpoints & Formats)” to `docs/cfbd/data_ingestion.md`.
- Created `docs/project_org/feature_catalog.md` and integrated it into site nav via `mkdocs.yml`.
- Expanded modeling baseline with “Artifacts and Metrics (Plan)” in `docs/project_org/modeling_baseline.md`.
- Updated weekly runbook outputs in `docs/operations/weekly_pipeline.md` (backtest artifacts).
- Resolved markdownlint issues (list/spacing), and scoped MD013 suppression for long tables in
  Feature Catalog.

## Blockers

- None blocking. Long table rows exceed MD013 limits by design; suppression is scoped to the
  affected tables only.

## Artifacts & Links

- Roadmap: `docs/planning/roadmap.md`
- CFBD Ingestion: `docs/cfbd/data_ingestion.md`
- Feature Catalog: `docs/project_org/feature_catalog.md`
- Modeling Baseline: `docs/project_org/modeling_baseline.md`
- Weekly Pipeline: `docs/operations/weekly_pipeline.md`
- Site Nav: `mkdocs.yml`
- Code Health: See [QG:PreCommit]

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Documentation reorg complete; navigation updated; markdownlint clean except
  scoped MD013 suppressions.
- Next Immediate Task: Scaffold CLI/scripts for features, training, backtesting, and weekly pipeline
  with `--data-root` support; add a small validation script for data counts.
- Known Issues: None new. Historical note: prior plays count verification discrepancy to be
  investigated by validation script.
- Next Session Context: Start with Minimal Context Pack (getting started, roadmap, decision log,
  modeling baseline, weekly pipeline). Build `scripts/features_cli.py`, `scripts/train_models.py`,
  `scripts/backtest.py`, `scripts/weekly_run.py` and wire outputs per docs.
