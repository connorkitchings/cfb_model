## Session Handoff

### 1. Session Accomplishments

- **Task Completed**: Hybrid Model Deployment & Weather Integration
- **Key Outcomes**:
  - **Retrained Production Models**: Retrained `spread_catboost` (RMSE 18.39) and `total_xgboost` (RMSE 16.99) using the fixed `standard_v1` feature set (including current weather).
  - **Deployed Hybrid Strategy**: Created `scripts/pipeline/generate_weekly_bets.py` to implement the "Hybrid Strategy" (CatBoost for Spreads, XGBoost for Totals) with optimized thresholds (5.0 / 5.5).
  - **Backfilled History**: Successfully generated hybrid predictions for 2025 Weeks 1-14.
  - **Documentation**: Updated `docs/decisions/decision_log.md` to document the retraining decision.

### 2. Blockers and Learnings

- **Learnings**:
  - **Feature Consistency**: It is critical to ensure that the feature set used for training matches the production pipeline. The mismatch between the "Session 1" models and the "Session 2" weather fix required a retraining step.
  - **Model Loading**: Loading models directly from `artifacts/models/` via `joblib` is simpler and less ambiguous than using the MLflow registry for this specific hybrid script.

### 3. Next Steps

- **Immediate Next Task**: Generate predictions for **Week 15** (once data is available).
- **Monitor**: Track the performance of the new Hybrid Strategy in live betting.
- **Future**: Begin research on **Probabilistic Power Ratings**.

### 4. Health Check

- **Linting**: Passed (`ruff check` and `format` on new script).
- **Tests**: Not run (no core logic changes, only script addition).
- **Docs**: Updated `decision_log.md`.
