# Session Log: Monitoring Dashboard & PPR Prototype

## Summary

This session focused on establishing a monitoring infrastructure and initiating the Probabilistic Power Ratings (PPR) research. We successfully built a Streamlit dashboard to track model performance and developed a prototype Bayesian rating model.

## Accomplishments

1.  **Monitoring Dashboard:**
    - Built a Streamlit app (`dashboard/app.py`) running locally on port 8501.
    - Features: Season Overview, Weekly Performance (with rolling 4-week metrics), and Edge Analysis.
    - Data Source: Reads directly from `data/production`.
2.  **Probabilistic Power Ratings (PPR):**
    - Created `scripts/ratings/train_ppr.py` using PyMC.
    - Implemented a static Bayesian Hierarchical Model.
    - Trained on 2024 data, yielding reasonable ratings (Notre Dame #1, Texas #2) and a Home Field Advantage of ~4.0 points.
3.  **Infrastructure:**
    - Added `plotly` dependency.
    - Created Docker configuration (though local execution was used due to network issues).

## Key Decisions

- **Local Dashboard:** Due to Docker network issues, we opted to run the dashboard locally using `uv sync` and `streamlit run`.
- **PPR Prototype:** Started with a static model (one rating per team per season) to validate the pipeline before adding time-varying dynamics.

## Next Steps

1.  **PPR Development:**
    - Implement dynamic ratings (random walk or AR process).
    - Backtest on 2019-2023 data.
2.  **Dashboard:**
    - Resolve Docker network issues for easier deployment.
    - Add more granular filters (e.g., by conference).
