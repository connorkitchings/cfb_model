# Session Dev Log - 2025-10-28

## Session Summary

### Task Completed:
- Ingested data, aggregated, generated bets, and sent emails for weeks 8, 9, and 10.

### Key Outcomes:
- Successfully ingested games, plays, and betting lines for weeks 8, 9, and 10.
- Successfully aggregated data for weeks 8 and 9.
- Successfully generated weekly betting recommendations for week 10.
- Successfully sent test and production emails for scored reports (week 9) and generated picks (week 10).

## Blockers and Learnings:

### Blockers Encountered:
- Initial `python` command failed due to not using `uv run python`.
- `cli.py ingest lines` failed because the entity was `betting_lines`.
- `generate_weekly_bets_clean.py` failed due to missing cached weekly adjusted stats.
- `publish_picks.py` failed due to `ModuleNotFoundError` when run directly, resolved by running as a module (`-m scripts.publish_picks`).
- `publish_review.py` failed for week 10 because bets were not scored yet.

### New Learnings/Patterns:
- Always use `uv run python` for scripts.
- When running scripts from `src/` or `scripts/` that have module dependencies, it's often necessary to run them as modules using `uv run python -m <module_path>`.
- Ingestion of `betting_lines` requires `games` to be ingested first for the same week.
- `cache_weekly_stats.py` is crucial for generating the "weekly adjusted stats" required by `generate_weekly_bets_clean.py`.
- Test failures related to `StorageError` in `LocalStorage` were resolved by ensuring `raw` and `processed` directories are created before `LocalStorage` initialization in test setup.
- `pytest` `AssertionError` in `test_load_running_season_snapshot_latest` was resolved by correcting the expected `before_week` and `games_played` values after understanding the filtering logic in `load_running_season_snapshot`.

## Next Steps:

### Immediate Next Task:
- None, session is closing.

### Weekly Predictions Check:
- Confirmed `CFB_week10_bets.csv` has one row per game.

## Final Health Check Results:

- `uv run ruff check .`: All checks passed!
- `uv run ruff format .`: 3 files reformatted, 70 files left unchanged
- `uv run pytest tests/ -q`: 44 passed in 1.40s
- `uv run mkdocs build --quiet`: Build successful.

## Documentation Updates:
- No direct documentation updates were made during this session.
