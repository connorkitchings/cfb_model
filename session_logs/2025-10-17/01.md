task: [IMPL-task:PLACEHOLDER] - Session wrap-up
---

## Wins

- Implemented metrics pipeline that writes per-week and season summaries to artifacts/reports/<year>/metrics/<year>\_results.csv
- Generated and scored weekly bets for 2025 Weeks 2–8 (predictions) and 2–7 (scored) using 2024 models
- Validated live-season RMSE/MAE vs. training metrics; re-ran model training to stage metrics under models/2024/metrics

## Blockers

- None; noted Ruff unavailable in environment (uv run ruff check fails: command not found)

## Artifacts & Links

- Metrics Summary (2024): artifacts/reports/2024/metrics/2024_results.csv
- Metrics Summary (2025): artifacts/reports/2025/metrics/2025_results.csv
- Model Eval Metrics: models/2024/metrics/model_eval_2024.csv

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: All requested reports generated; metrics aligned with evaluation results
- Next Immediate Task: Configure Ruff/formatter tooling so wrap-up health checks succeed
- Known Issues: Ruff command missing in environment (documented)
- Next Session Context: Continue weekly automation or explore threshold config
