branch: [NOT-SET]
task: [IMPL-S4-EMAIL] - Refresh email workflows & context packs
---

## Wins

- Curated Minimal Context Pack across `WARP.md`, `gemini.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `docs/guides/ai_session_templates.md` to align docs and code anchors.
- Upgraded review and picks email flows with inline logo support, refined scoring template layout, and streamlined bet wording (`templates/email_last_week_review.html`, `scripts/publish_review.py`, `scripts/publish_picks.py`).
- Verified model-context metrics logic now draws from scored reports and season summaries via `compute_hit_rates`/`compute_week_hit_rates` fixes.
- Added UConn logo alias so prediction and review emails display the correct crest.

## Blockers

- Outbound SMTP calls fail in this sandbox (`smtp.gmail.com` blocked), preventing live send tests.
- `uv run ruff check .` cannot access the uv cache in this environment (`Operation not permitted`).
- No consensus line yet for Lafayette @ Oregon State; betting lines ingestion currently returns `NaN`.

## Artifacts & Links

- Context guidance: `WARP.md`, `gemini.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/guides/ai_session_templates.md`
- Email templates/scripts: `templates/email_last_week_review.html`, `scripts/publish_review.py`, `scripts/publish_picks.py`
- Metrics utilities: `scripts/publish_picks.py` (`compute_hit_rates`, `compute_week_hit_rates`)
- Data gap note: `artifacts/reports/2025/predictions/CFB_week8_bets.csv:58`

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Email templates refreshed; prediction metrics confirmed; week 8 report ready pending missing line ingest.
- Next Immediate Task: Finalize Sprint 4 MLOps items (Hydra/Optuna integration, Hydra-driven pipeline refactor, MLflow registry hookup).
- Known Issues: SMTP blocked in sandbox; Lafayette @ Oregon State lacks a sportsbook line; `uv run ruff check` fails without cache access.
- Next Session Context: Re-run betting line ingestion once data posts, regenerate week 8 predictions, then proceed with Hydra/Optuna integration work.
