task: Knowledge ramp-up and next-steps planning

## Summary
- Reviewed core project documentation (charter, roadmap, modeling baseline, feature catalog, betting policy, weekly pipeline) plus the points-for design note to understand architecture, operating cadence, and in-flight initiatives.
- Surveyed anchor modules (`src/config.py`, storage utilities, feature pipeline/persistence, ensemble training, weekly bet generation, CLI tooling, representative tests) to map code entrypoints to the documented processes.
- Read the last three days of session logs (2025-10-19â†’21) to capture current progress on Hydra/Optuna integration, walk-forward validation, data ingestion, and points-for experimentation.
- Compiled an initial action plan highlighting immediate follow-ups for hyperparameter sweeps, validation reruns, points-for evaluation, and weekly operations chores.

## Blockers
- None observed during the ramp-up; pending work items depend on rerunning compute-heavy scripts once approvals are in.

## Next Steps
- Re-run the hardened Hydra/Optuna sweeps and capture MLflow outputs for review.
- Execute the enhanced walk-forward validation with the new strategy toggles and analyze ensemble vs single-model performance deltas.
- Advance the points-for initiative by answering open design questions, validating training slices, and calibrating variance estimates before broader rollout.
- Coordinate upcoming weekly pipeline runs (Week 9 predictions onward), ensuring caches and reporting artifacts remain current.
