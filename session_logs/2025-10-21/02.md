task: Fix hyperparameter tuning pipeline and extend walk-forward analysis
---

## Summary
- Hardened `scripts/optimize_hyperparameters.py` to derive training targets from cached game scores when absent and to surface actionable errors when data is incomplete, eliminating the `KeyError` that stopped Hydra/Optuna sweeps.
- Extended `scripts/walk_forward_validation.py` with configurable spread/total strategies (ensemble vs. best single model), per-season and overall aggregation, and persisted/MLflow-logged summary metrics for faster comparison of model choices.
- Added Hydra defaults for the walk-forward strategy knobs so analysts can toggle totals between ensemble and the random forest performer without code edits.

## Wins
- Hyperparameter optimization now guards against missing targets while staying aligned with the point-in-time feature loader.
- Walk-forward validation automatically emits both yearly CSVs and an overall metrics report keyed to the configured strategy.
- Strategy switches validated at runtime to prevent typos from silently skipping metrics.

## Blockers
- None; downstream validation still needs to be re-run once data snapshots are available.

## Next Steps
- Re-run `uv run python scripts/optimize_hyperparameters.py` with desired sweeps to confirm MLflow captures the tuned trials end to end.
- Execute the refreshed walk-forward validation to populate the new summary CSV and review ensemble vs. best-single totals performance.

## Final Health Check
- `uv run ruff check .`: ⭕️ not run
- `uv run ruff format .`: ⭕️ not run
- `uv run pytest`: ⭕️ not run
- `uv run mkdocs build --quiet`: ⭕️ not run
