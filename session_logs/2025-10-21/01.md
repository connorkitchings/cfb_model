task: [IMPL-task:WALK-FORWARD-VALIDATION] - Analyze walk-forward validation results.
---

## Summary

This session focused on analyzing the results of the walk-forward validation. We calculated the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for individual spread and total models, as well as their ensembles. The analysis revealed that the spread ensemble outperforms individual spread models, while the total random forest model performs better than the total ensemble.

## Wins

- Successfully read all prediction files from the walk-forward validation.
- Calculated MAE and RMSE for all individual spread and total models.
- Calculated MAE and RMSE for the spread and total ensembles.
- Identified that the spread ensemble is the best performer for spread prediction.
- Identified that the `total_pred_random_forest` model is the best performer for total prediction, outperforming the total ensemble.

## Blockers

- Initial attempt to run the analysis script failed due to a missing `tabulate` dependency. This was resolved by installing the dependency.

## Learnings

- `tabulate` is a required dependency for `pandas.DataFrame.to_markdown()`.

## Next Steps

- **Immediate Next Task:** Fix the hyperparameter optimization script (`scripts/optimize_hyperparameters.py`) to use the new `load_point_in_time_data` function and resolve the `KeyError`.

## Final Health Check

- `uv run ruff check .`: ✅
- `uv run ruff format .`: ✅
- `uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short`: ✅
- `uv run mkdocs build --quiet`: ✅
