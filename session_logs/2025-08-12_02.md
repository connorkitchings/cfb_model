# Session Log - 2025-08-12_02

## Session Details

- **Date**: 2025-08-12
- **Time**: [Current Time - Placeholder]
- **Attendees**: AI Assistant, User

## Session Focus

Continuing implementation of play-level feature engineering.

## Accomplishments

- **Task Completed**: IMPL-task:FE-01 - Implement play-level feature transformations.
- **Key Outcomes**:
    - Implemented `update_yards_gained`, `calculate_explosive`, `calculate_play_success`, and `calculate_time_features` in `src/cfb_model/features/play_features.py`.
    - Refined `allplays_to_byplay` with robust binary logic and constants from `API_Functions.ipynb`.
    - Integrated `apply_updates_to_dataframe` and `conditions_and_updates` for data cleaning.
    - Created `data/processed_data` directory at the specified external data root.

## Blockers and Learnings

- **Blockers Encountered**: None that prevented progress. Clarification was needed regarding the scope of API function integration and aggregation.
- **New Learnings/Patterns**:
    - The importance of clear communication regarding the scope of tasks (e.g., "do not integrate old API functions").
    - The detailed play-level feature engineering logic from `API_Functions.ipynb` provides a robust foundation for play-level transformations.

## Next Steps

- **Immediate Next Task**: Confirm the play-level transformations are finalized and then proceed with aggregating play data to drive data.

## Session Handoff

The play-level feature transformations are now implemented in `src/cfb_model/features/play_features.py`, incorporating logic from `API_Functions.ipynb` and including data cleaning updates. The `data/processed_data` directory has been created. The next step is to confirm the completeness of these transformations and then move on to aggregating play data to drive data.
