# Dev Log - 2025-09-24_01

## Session Details
- **Date:** 2025-09-24
- **Time:** [Current Time]
- **Task:** Refactor spread/result logic, implement point-in-time feature generation, retrain model.

## Accomplishments
- **Task Completed:** Refactored spread and result logic for clarity; implemented point-in-time feature generation to prevent data leakage; retrained model with corrected logic.
- **Key Outcomes:**
    - Standardized `home_team_result` and `home_team_spread_line` columns for explicit interpretation of game outcomes and betting lines in `generate_weekly_bets_clean.py` and `score_weekly_picks.py`.
    - Updated `docs/project_org/feature_catalog.md` to document the new naming convention.
    - Implemented `generate_point_in_time_features` in `src/cfb_model/models/features.py` to ensure that model training and prediction use only historical data, eliminating a critical data leakage bug.
    - Updated `src/cfb_model/models/ridge_baseline/train.py` and `src/cfb_model/scripts/generate_weekly_bets_clean.py` to use the new leakage-free feature generation.
    - Retrained the model with the corrected logic and new training/test year split (2017-2022 train, 2023 test).
    - Confirmed that the implemented point-in-time logic aligns with proven patterns from `CFB_Functions.ipynb`.

## Blockers & Learnings
- **Blockers Encountered:** The pre-aggregation data (`team_game`, `team_season`, `team_season_adj`) for 2017 and 2018 is missing, preventing the model from being fully trained on the desired historical range. The `train.py` script currently skips weeks for these years due to `No team_game data found`.
- **New Learnings/Patterns:** The critical importance of strict point-in-time feature generation for time-series data to prevent data leakage, even when using aggregated features. This was confirmed by comparing the implemented solution to existing notebook logic.

## Next Steps
- **Immediate Next Task:** Run the pre-aggregation pipeline for 2017 and 2018 to generate the missing `team_game` data. This will unblock the full training of the model on the desired historical range.

## Session Handoff
- The model has been updated to prevent data leakage by using point-in-time feature generation. The next step is to generate the missing pre-aggregated data for 2017 and 2018 to allow for full historical training.
