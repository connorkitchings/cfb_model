task: [PIPELINE-REFACTOR-EXEC] - Execute full-season runs and refactor the data pipeline.
---

## Wins

- Successfully ran the full hybrid-model pipeline for the 2024 season and the first 6 weeks of the 2025 season, generating and scoring all bets.
- Identified and fixed multiple critical bugs in the prediction and analysis scripts related to feature mismatches, index length errors, and incorrect hit rate calculations.
- Refactored the weekly feature caching pipeline into a more modular, two-stage process (non-adjusted aggregation, then opponent adjustment) as requested.
- Confirmed the 2024 totals model hit rate is ~63%, validating user expectations.

## Blockers

- The session was repeatedly blocked by bugs in the prediction and analysis scripts, which required several iterations of debugging and patching. These were all eventually resolved.

## Artifacts & Links

- Learnings:
  - `[KB:PrecomputationModularity]` - Splitting a complex precomputation step into modular stages improves maintainability and makes it easier to experiment with individual parts of the pipeline.
  - `[KB:DataDiscrepancy]` - Discrepancies between aggregated summary files and the sum of their weekly parts indicate a bug in the aggregation or scoring process.
  - `[KB:DefensiveDebugging]` - When a script produces nonsensical results, the issue is likely a logical bug in the script's data handling, not the underlying model.
- Code Health: All linting and formatting issues were resolved. All tests pass. Docs build successfully.
- Decisions: `[PRD-decision:2025-10-09]`

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: The requested analysis for 2024 and 2025 is complete, and the pipeline has been refactored. The codebase is in a clean and stable state.
- Next Immediate Task: The user's request is complete. The next logical step is to analyze the generated Week 7 picks and prepare for the weekly operational run.
- Known Issues: None.
