branch: main
task: [IMPL-task:AGG-VAL-DOC] - Finalize, validate, and document the data aggregation pipeline.
---

## Wins

- Fixed the logging mechanism in the aggregation scripts to correctly display team names by creating
  a game-to-team lookup map.
- Successfully ran the full aggregation pipeline for all seasons from 2014-2024 (excluding 2020),
  generating all processed datasets.
- Refactored the validation script (`src/cfb_model/data/validation.py`) to support the new processed
  CSV data structure and added checks for all aggregation levels.
- Validated all generated aggregation data for the entire 10-year period, confirming data integrity
  and readiness for modeling.
- Created a new `data_dictionary.md` file documenting the schemas for raw plays, processed plays,
  drives, team-game, and team-season datasets.
- Integrated the new data dictionary into the `mkdocs.yml` navigation for easy access.

## Blockers

- The validation script initially failed with an `ImportError` due to being run as a script instead
  of a module. This was resolved by using the `python -m` flag.

## Artifacts & Links

- New Documentation: `docs/guides/data_dictionary.md`
- Updated Validation Script: `src/cfb_model/data/validation.py`
- Updated Aggregation Persistence: `src/cfb_model/data/aggregations/persist.py`
- Updated Site Navigation: `mkdocs.yml`

## Learnings/Patterns

- `[KB:PythonModuleExecution]`: When a Python script within a package uses relative imports
  (`from . import ...`), it must be run as a module from the project root
  (`python -m package.module`) to ensure the package structure is correctly recognized and avoid
  `ImportError`.
- `[KB:DataframeColumnTrace]`: A robust fix for columns being dropped in a pandas pipeline is to
  create a lookup map from the initial dataframe rather than passing the columns through every
  transformation step. This was used to fix the logging of team names.

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point**: The data aggregation pipeline is complete, and all data has been generated
  and validated. The data schemas are now fully documented.
- **Next Immediate Task**: Begin the modeling phase by scaffolding the training and prediction
  scripts to consume the newly validated `team_season_adj` aggregated data.
