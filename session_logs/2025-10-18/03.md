task: [IMPL-task:DATA-INTEGRITY-FIX] - Diagnose and fix root cause of data directory creation and validation failures.
---

## Wins

- Identified that the `LocalStorage` class was silently creating a local `data/` directory when the `CFB_MODEL_DATA_ROOT` environment variable was not found.
- Modified `LocalStorage` to remove automatic directory creation, ensuring it will now fail explicitly if the data root does not exist. This prevents the creation of unwanted directories and makes path resolution errors obvious.
- Successfully applied this fix to the codebase.

## Blockers

- The `replace` tool was difficult to use with multi-line strings, requiring several attempts to get the `old_string` parameter correct. Reverting the file with `git checkout` was a necessary reset step.

## Artifacts & Links

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point:** The data pipeline is now more robust against configuration errors. The project is ready to return to the original task of testing the modeling modules on the clean datasets (2019, 2022, 2023).
- **Next Immediate Task:** Proceed with testing the modeling modules by training on the clean 2019 and 2022 datasets and testing on the 2023 dataset.
- **Known Issues:** The 2024 data validation is still failing due to a separate, complex data issue. This should be addressed in a separate task.
- **Next Session Context:** The next session should focus on executing the model training and evaluation pipeline.
