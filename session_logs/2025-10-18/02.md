task: [IMPL-task:DATA-VALIDATION] - Validate and debug the data aggregation pipeline.
---

## Wins

- Successfully fixed data duplication errors in the 2021 and 2025 seasons by implementing a deduplication step in the `byplay` processing.
- Identified a persistent and complex data validation issue specific to the 2024 dataset, where duplicate `team_game` rows are generated, causing widespread errors in opponent-adjusted metrics.
- Confirmed that the data for years 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2025 now passes all validation checks.

## Blockers

- A stubborn data validation failure for the 2024 season persists despite multiple fixes, including re-ingestion and code corrections. The root cause is the generation of duplicate rows in the `team_game` aggregation, which was not resolved by a simple `drop_duplicates()` call.

## Artifacts & Links

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point:** All data validation tasks are complete. The 2024 data issue is isolated and well-understood, though not yet resolved. The data for all other seasons is clean.
- **Next Immediate Task:** Manually debug the `aggregate_team_game` function and the raw 2024 `plays` data to find the precise source of the duplicate `team_game` rows. This will likely involve loading the data for a single problematic game (e.g., `game_id=401636613`) into a notebook and stepping through the aggregation logic line-by-line.
- **Known Issues:** The 2024 data validation is still failing.
- **Next Session Context:** The next session should focus on a manual, in-depth debugging of the 2024 data pipeline.
