task: [IMPL-task:DATA-VALID-TRAIN-FIX] - Diagnose and fix data validation and model training issues.
---

## Wins

- Successfully fixed the data validation issue for the 2024 dataset.
- Successfully ran the model training pipeline for the 2024 test year.
- Investigated and documented the `RuntimeWarning`s during model training, suspecting multicollinearity as the cause.
- Fixed failing tests related to data storage path validation.

## Blockers

- `RuntimeWarning`s during model training persist, but do not block execution.

## Artifacts & Links

- Learnings: [KB:PYTHONPATH-FOR-MODULES]
- Learnings: [KB:MULTICOLLINEARITY-WARNINGS]

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: The data validation and model training pipelines are now running successfully. The root cause of the `RuntimeWarning`s has been narrowed down to likely multicollinearity.
- Next Immediate Task: Decide whether to perform a deep dive into multicollinearity analysis or to proceed with the current model training results.
- Known Issues: `RuntimeWarning`s in the training pipeline.
- Next Session Context: Review the multicollinearity issue and decide on a course of action.
