branch: main
task: [IMPL-task:analysis-cli] - Consolidate scripting and CLIs
---

## Wins

- Introduced consolidated CLIs (`scripts/analysis_cli.py`, `scripts/training_cli.py`) and registered them under the main CLI.
- Removed redundant prediction/analysis scripts and unified weekly caching into a single staged command.
- Updated documentation and knowledge base to reflect the new workflow and MLflow artifacts location.

## Blockers

- Sandbox cannot execute `uv` commands due to restricted cache permissions (fails opening `/Users/connorkitchings/.cache/uv/...`).

## Artifacts & Links

- Analysis CLI patterns: [KB:AnalysisCLI]
- Training CLI patterns: [KB:TrainingCLI]
- Staged caching update: see [PRD-decision:2025-10-09]
- Code Health: See [QG:PreCommit]

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: CLIs refactored, docs aligned, and MLflow output relocated under `artifacts/`.
- Next Immediate Task: Run ingestion/aggregation/training commands locally with real data roots to validate end-to-end.
- Known Issues: `uv` commands cannot run in sandbox; requires local execution.
- Next Session Context: Confirm pipeline commands succeed on the actual data store and update any remaining docs if gaps appear.
