task: [IMPL-task:MLOPS-HYDRA] - Integrate Hydra and Optuna for hyperparameter optimization.
---

## Summary

This session focused on integrating Hydra and Optuna for hyperparameter optimization. A new script `scripts/optimize_hyperparameters.py` was created, along with the necessary Hydra configuration files. The project dependencies were updated, and the model training scripts were refactored to support the new optimization workflow. However, the session ended with a persistent `KeyError` that needs to be resolved.

## Wins

- Successfully created a new script `scripts/optimize_hyperparameters.py` to run hyperparameter sweeps.
- Created Hydra configuration files for the optimization process and for each model.
- Added `hydra-core`, `hydra-optuna-sweeper`, and `optuna` to the project dependencies.
- Refactored `src/models/train_model.py` to make the model dictionaries importable.
- Refactored `scripts/training_cli.py` to remove redundant model definitions.

## Blockers

- The hyperparameter optimization script is failing with a `KeyError: ['spread_target', 'total_target']`.
- The `train_df` DataFrame is empty, even after running the pre-aggregation scripts and setting the correct data root.
- Debugging has been difficult due to the complex interaction between Hydra, the script, and the data loading logic.

## Learnings

- `[KB:HYDRA-SWEEPER-CONFIG]` Hydra's Optuna sweeper requires parameter distributions to be defined in the main `config.yaml` under `hydra.sweeper.params`, not in the model-specific config files.
- `[KB:HYDRA-STRUCT-OVERRIDE]` When a Hydra config is "structured" (i.e., uses `_self_` in the defaults list), command-line overrides for keys that don't exist in the config files must be prefixed with a `+`.
- `[KB:HYDRA-ENV-INTERPOLATION]` Hydra does not support overriding a config value that uses environment variable interpolation. The environment variable must be set before running the script.
- `[KB:PYTHON-IMPORT-CACHE]` Python's import caching can cause unexpected behavior when modules are changed. Clearing `.pyc` files can help resolve these issues.

## Next Steps

- **Immediate Next Task:** The `KeyError` and the empty `train_df` need to be resolved. The next step is to continue debugging `generate_point_in_time_features` to understand why it's not returning any data, even though the `team_game` data exists.
