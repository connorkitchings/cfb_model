task: Build filtered points-for training slice
---

## Summary

- Rebuilt the 2023 points-for prototype dataset while enforcing the project requirement that both teams have at least two prior FBS games (`games_played >= 2`) before inclusion.
- Joined raw game scores with opponent-adjusted features from Week 3 onward (Weeks 3â€“15 retained) and wrote 650 matchups to `outputs/prototypes/points_for_training_slice_2023_filtered.csv`.
- Automatically excluded FCS opponents and early-season games lacking `team_week_adj` features; recorded counts for missing features (54) and insufficient history (70) to inform any backfill work.
- Added `scripts/build_points_for_slice.py` so future seasons can regenerate the slice with a single command (supports `--season`, `--min-games`, and `--data-root` overrides).
- Ran a quick QA script to confirm target distributions (spread min/max, totals) and feature ranges (adj_off_epa_pp, adj_off_sr, etc.); verified every team appears at least five times and no rows have missing scores.
- Introduced `scripts/train_points_for_models.py` to persist paired home/away predictors and `scripts/report_model_comparison.py` to summarize scored results across modes; wired weekly generator with a `--prediction-mode` flag for side-by-side analysis.

## Next Steps

- Evaluate the filtered slice for target/feature sanity (basic stats, distribution checks) and confirm no lingering FCS teams remain.
- Translate the extraction logic into a reusable helper or notebook for future seasons before integrating with Hydra/Optuna training.
