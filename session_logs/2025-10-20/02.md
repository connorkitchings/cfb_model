task: Document points-for modeling exploration
---

## Summary

- Logged the kickoff decision for evaluating a unified points-for model so the initiative has traceability (`docs/decisions/decision_log.md`).
- Authored `docs/planning/points_for_model.md` capturing objectives, data/model implications, risks, and open questions.
- Added temporary cross-references in key docs (modeling baseline, weekly pipeline, feature catalog) to signal the pending architecture change.

## Next Steps

- Resolve open questions in the design note with stakeholders (model form, fallback strategy, tuning approach).
- Validate data readiness by assembling example training slices with home/away scoring targets.
- Coordinate with the ongoing Hydra/Optuna work so optimization can support the new modeling flow once approved.
