task: [IMPL-task:REFACTOR-VALIDATION] - Refactor walk-forward validation script for performance and clarity.
---

## Wins

- Successfully refactored `scripts/walk_forward_validation.py` to use cached `team_week_adj` data instead of recalculating features, dramatically improving performance.
- Added detailed, step-by-step logging to the validation script to provide clarity during long runs.
- Centralized data loading logic by creating a `load_point_in_time_data` function in `src/models/features.py`, now used by both the training and validation scripts.
- Cleaned up the codebase by removing the legacy `generate_point_in_time_features` function and fixing all resulting `ImportError`s in `scripts/training_cli.py` and `src/models/train_model.py`.
- Added a context manager to the validation script to suppress benign runtime warnings from linear models, resulting in cleaner output.
- Successfully executed the improved walk-forward validation script, generating new analysis artifacts.

## Blockers

- No blockers. The initial performance issue was identified and resolved.

## Learnings

- `[KB:PERFORMANCE-BOTTLENECK]` Identified that on-the-fly feature calculation in a walk-forward validation loop is a major performance bottleneck. Using a pre-calculated weekly cache (`team_week_adj`) is critical.
- `[KB:REFACTORING-IMPORTS]` Removing a function requires a project-wide check for its usages. Test failures in `test_imports.py` were key to finding and fixing dangling references in multiple scripts.
- `[KB:TYPER-CLI-STRUCTURE]` A `typer` CLI script that is imported by another Typer app must expose a top-level `app` object.

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point:** The walk-forward validation script has been successfully refactored and executed. The codebase is clean, tested, and all checks are passing. New validation artifacts have been generated in `artifacts/validation/walk_forward/`.
- **Next Immediate Task:** Analyze the results of the completed walk-forward validation to compare the performance of the different models in the ensemble.
- **Final Health Check:**
