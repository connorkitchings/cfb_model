task: [IMPL-task:WALK-FORWARD-VALIDATION] - Create and debug a walk-forward validation script.
---

## Summary

This session focused on creating and debugging a walk-forward validation script to evaluate model performance over time. The session started by fixing a `KeyError` in the hyperparameter optimization script, which was caused by an incorrect Hydra configuration. Then, a new walk-forward validation script was created, and several `KeyError`s were debugged and fixed. The script is now operational and generating prediction files.

## Wins

- Successfully debugged and fixed the hyperparameter optimization script (`scripts/optimize_hyperparameters.py`).
- Created a new walk-forward validation script (`scripts/walk_forward_validation.py`).
- Successfully debugged and fixed multiple `KeyError`s in the new script.
- The walk-forward validation script is now operational and generating prediction files.

## Blockers

- None.

## Learnings

- `[KB:HYDRA-INTERPOLATION]` Older versions of Hydra might not support the `${env:VAR}` syntax for environment variable interpolation. Use `${oc.env:VAR}` instead.
- `[KB:PANDAS-COLUMN-NAMES]` Be aware that the column name for the game identifier in the raw `games` data is `id`, not `game_id`.
- `[KB:LIST-DIRECTORY-IGNORES]` The `list_directory` tool respects `.gitignore` by default. Use `file_filtering_options=ListDirectoryFileFilteringOptions(respect_git_ignore=False)` to disable this behavior.

## Next Steps

- **Immediate Next Task:** Enhance the `walk_forward_validation.py` script to be more configurable (e.g., allow model selection from the command line) and run it for all years in the dataset.
