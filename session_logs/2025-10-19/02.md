task: [IMPL-task:MULTICOLLINEARITY-CLEANUP] - Suppress benign training RuntimeWarning noise.
---

## Wins

- Verified the noisy `divide/overflow` RuntimeWarnings stem from NumPy `matmul` internals rather than ill-conditioned features (condition number ~49 after scaling).
- Added `_suppress_linear_runtime_warnings()` in `src/models/train_model.py` to wrap spread/total model fit and prediction, eliminating the warning spam while preserving the Ridge/ElasticNet/Huber ensemble.

## Blockers

- None blocking; warnings are now suppressed intentionally.

## Artifacts & Links

- Code: `src/models/train_model.py`
- Log: session context updated in `session_logs/2025-10-19/01.md`.

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Training pipeline runs cleanly with warning suppression and baseline ensemble restored.
- Next Immediate Task: Build the walk-forward validation runner to generate per-season metrics and aggregated predictions.
- Known Issues: None new; continue tracking model variance impacts from earlier feature tweaks.
- Next Session Context: Begin implementing the walk-forward script and MLflow hooks per next-steps plan.
