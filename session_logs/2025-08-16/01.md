task: [IMPL-task:model-org-and-ridge] - Organize model code by type, add multi-year ridge baseline, and document
---

## Wins

- Added ridge_baseline package with multi-year train/eval
  (train: 2019,2021,2022,2023; test: 2024).
- Models saved to `models/ridge_baseline/2024/`; metrics CSV written.
- Weekly bets script defaults to `./models/ridge_baseline`; merges aligned with schemas.
- Added `docs/models/ridge_baseline.md`; nav updated under “Models”.

## Blockers

- None encountered. Assumes raw `games` and `betting_lines` exist for target years.

## Artifacts & Links

- Code: `src/cfb_model/models/ridge_baseline/train.py`,
  `src/cfb_model/scripts/generate_weekly_bets.py`
- Models: `models/ridge_baseline/<year>/ridge_spread.joblib`, `ridge_total.joblib`
- Metrics: `reports/metrics/ridge_baseline_eval_2024.csv`
- Docs: `docs/models/ridge_baseline.md`, nav in `mkdocs.yml`

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Ridge baseline added; train/eval CLI ready; docs and weekly script aligned.
- Next Immediate Task: Run train/eval with `--data-root`; verify metrics and generate a 2024 weekly CSV.
- Known Issues: Ensure 2024 betting lines are ingested before the weekly run.
- Next Session Context: Add home-field indicator; consider alpha tuning/CV; add SHAP.
