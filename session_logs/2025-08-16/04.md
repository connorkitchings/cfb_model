task: [IMPL-task:FE-RUSHING-ANALYTICS] - Implement advanced rushing metrics and update documentation.
---

## Wins

- Successfully implemented the **Deeper Rushing Analysis** feature set, including
  `line_yards`, `power_success_rate`, `second_level_yards`, and `open_field_yards`.
- The new features were integrated into the full aggregation pipeline: play-level, game-level,
  season-level, and the opponent-adjustment process.
- Updated all relevant documentation, including the transformed data schemas (`plays.md`,
  `team_game.md`) and the `feature_catalog.md`, to reflect the new metrics.

## Blockers

- A minor workflow issue occurred where a file modification failed due to stale content; this was
  resolved by re-reading the file before applying the change.

## Artifacts & Links

- Updated Aggregation Code: `src/cfb_model/data/aggregations/byplay.py`, `src/cfb_model/data/aggregations/core.py`
- Updated Documentation: `docs/data/transformed/`, `docs/project_org/feature_catalog.md`

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point**: The rushing analytics features are fully implemented and documented.
- **Next Immediate Task**: Begin implementation of the next feature improvement plan:
  **Advanced Drive Analysis** (Successful, Busted, and Explosive Drive Rates).
- **Known Issues**: None.
- **Next Session Context**: Start by modifying the `drives` aggregation in
  `src/cfb_model/data/aggregations/core.py` to add the new drive-level analytics flags.
