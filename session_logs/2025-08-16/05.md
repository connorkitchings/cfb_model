branch: main
task: [IMPL-task:FE-DRIVE-RUSH-ANALYTICS] - Implement advanced rushing and drive metrics.
---

## Wins

- Successfully implemented the **Deeper Rushing Analysis** feature set, including
  `line_yards`, `power_success_rate`, and second-level/open-field yards.
- Successfully implemented the **Advanced Drive Analysis** feature set, including
  `successful_drive_rate`, `busted_drive_rate`, and `explosive_drive_rate` for both offense and
  defense.
- All new features have been integrated into the full aggregation pipeline (play, game, season,
  and opponent-adjustment levels).
- Updated all relevant data dictionary and feature catalog documentation to reflect the new metrics.

## Blockers

- None.

## Artifacts & Links

- Updated Aggregation Code: `src/cfb_model/data/aggregations/byplay.py`, `src/cfb_model/data/aggregations/core.py`
- Updated Documentation: `docs/data/transformed/`, `docs/project_org/feature_catalog.md`

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point**: Rushing and Drive analytics features are fully implemented and documented.
- **Next Immediate Task**: Begin implementation of the final planned feature improvement:
  **Granular Special Teams Metrics**.
- **Known Issues**: None.
- **Next Session Context**: Start by modifying the `byplay` aggregation in
  `src/cfb_model/data/aggregations/byplay.py` to calculate `net_punt_yards` and field goal success
  by distance.
