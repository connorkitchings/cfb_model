branch: main
task: [IMPL-docs:align-modeling-workflow] - Align modeling workflow and validation across docs
---

## Wins

- Unified training/evaluation policy across docs: train 2014â€“2023 (exclude 2020), final test on 2024.
- Clarified anti-leakage and home-field policies; kept lines out of model features (edge-only).
- Added ingestion validation gates (schema, ranges, referential integrity, manifests).
- Switched feature-engineering plan outputs to CSV partitions under `processed/*` + season summary CSV.

## Blockers

- None today. MLflow/registry details and monitoring will be deferred until modeling phase.

## Artifacts & Links

- Docs updated: `docs/models/ridge_baseline.md`, `docs/project_org/modeling_baseline.md`,
  `docs/cfbd/data_ingestion.md`, `docs/guides/feature_engineering_plan.md`.
- References: `[LOG:2025-08-12]` opponent-adjustment policy; feature ranges in
  `docs/project_org/feature_catalog.md`.

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Documentation aligned with agreed modeling workflow and validation.
- Next Immediate Task: Implement aggregation CLI validations and season summary output; add a
  config template.
- Known Issues: Ensure train and weekly scripts enforce anti-leakage consistently.
- Next Session Context: Start wiring validation into `scripts/aggregations_cli.py` and add smoke
  tests.
