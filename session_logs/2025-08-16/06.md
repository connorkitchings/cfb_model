task: [IMPL-task:FE-ALL] - Implement all planned advanced features (Rushing, Drive, and Special Teams analytics).
---

## Wins

- **Completed all planned feature engineering tasks**:
  - Implemented **Deeper Rushing Analysis** (`line_yards`, `power_success_rate`, etc.).
  - Implemented **Advanced Drive Analysis** (`successful`, `busted`, `explosive` drive rates).
  - Implemented **Granular Special Teams Metrics** (`net_punt_yards`, FG rates by distance).
- All new features have been successfully integrated into the core aggregation pipeline at the play, game, and season levels, including opponent-adjustment.
- All relevant data dictionary and feature catalog documentation has been updated to reflect the new, richer feature set.

## Blockers

- No blockers.

## Artifacts & Links

- Updated Aggregation Code: `src/cfb_model/data/aggregations/byplay.py`, `src/cfb_model/data/aggregations/core.py`
- Updated Documentation: `docs/data/`

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point**: All planned feature engineering work is complete and documented. The data pipeline is now capable of generating a much more sophisticated set of metrics.
- **Next Immediate Task**: Re-run the entire aggregation pipeline for all years to generate the new features. After that, retrain the baseline model using this enriched dataset and evaluate its performance against the previous baseline.
- **Known Issues**: None.
- **Next Session Context**: Begin by running `scripts/aggregations_cli.py preagg --year <year>` for all seasons in scope. Then, run the model training script `src/cfb_model/models/ridge_baseline/train.py` and analyze the resulting metrics.
