# Development Session Log

## Summary of Accomplishments

- Code quality and docs readiness
  - Resolved Ruff issues (import ordering, trailing newlines).
  - Added module-level docstrings across priority packages to improve mkdocstrings output.
  - Expanded Google-style docstrings for core public functions (aggregations, pipeline, flows, modeling helpers, reporting).
- Testing
  - Added smoke tests for imports and docstring presence.
  - Added synthetic unit tests for aggregate_drives and aggregate_team_game (no external data needed).
  - All tests passing (10 passed) and lint clean.
- Architecture and flows
  - Extracted shared modeling features utilities to src/cfb_model/models/features.py and refactored ridge baseline/train_model to use them.
  - Introduced config module (src/cfb_model/config.py) for data_root and logo path resolution.
  - Fixed Prefect example flow logger usage; added new preaggregations Prefect flow (preaggregations_flow).

## Artifacts Changed
- New files:
  - src/cfb_model/config.py
  - src/cfb_model/flows/preaggregations.py
  - src/cfb_model/models/features.py
  - tests/test_aggregate_drives_minimal.py
  - tests/test_aggregate_team_game_minimal.py
- Edited files (high-level):
  - src/cfb_model/data/aggregations/{byplay,core,pipeline,persist}.py
  - src/cfb_model/models/{ridge_baseline/train.py,train_model.py}
  - src/cfb_model/scripts/generate_weekly_bets.py
  - src/cfb_model/utils/visualizations.py
  - src/cfb_model/flows/example_flow.py
  - tests/{test_imports.py,test_docstrings_smoke.py}

## Key Outcomes
- Modeling code de-duplicated via shared features module.
- Prefect flow available to run pre-aggregations parametrically.
- Config centralization reduces hard-coded paths and eases local testing without external drive.
- Documentation content (docstrings) greatly improved for mkdocstrings pages.

## Blockers
- None.

## New Learnings / Patterns
- Keeping data contracts explicit in docstrings clarifies mkdocstrings output and helps write synthetic tests.
- Small synthetic DataFrames are effective for validating aggregations without data availability.

## Next Steps
- Optional: add consolidated CLI (scripts/cli.py) with subcommands (ingest, preagg, model).
- Optional: add a unit test for models/features.load_merged_dataset via mocking storage.
- Optional: add a "Data Contracts" page summarizing required inputs/outputs per pipeline stage.

## Verification
- Lint: uv run ruff check . → All checks passed.
- Tests: uv run pytest -q → 10 passed.
- Docs build: uv run mkdocs build --strict → Successful build; some pages intentionally hidden from nav.
