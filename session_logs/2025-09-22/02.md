task: [IMPL-task:IMPROVE-TESTS-DOCS-CLI] - Enhanced test coverage, created data contracts documentation, and refactored CLI scripts.
---

## Wins

- Added new unit tests for data aggregation functions (`aggregate_team_season`, `apply_iterative_opponent_adjustment`) using synthetic data, and fixed a bug related to empty DataFrame inputs.
- Created a new "Data Contracts" documentation page (`docs/data/data_contracts.md`) to centralize schema definitions for all major data pipeline stages and updated the site navigation.
- Refactored the command-line interface by consolidating `ingest_cli.py` and `aggregations_cli.py` into a single, more robust `scripts/cli.py` using `typer`.

## Blockers

- The refactored CLI script initially failed with a `ModuleNotFoundError` because the `src` directory was not in the Python path. This was resolved by adding `sys.path` modification logic to the script.

## Artifacts & Links

- New Tests: `tests/test_aggregations_core.py`
- New Docs: `docs/data/data_contracts.md`
- Refactored CLI: `scripts/cli.py`

## Learnings/Patterns

- `[KB:TestWithSyntheticData]`: Unit tests for data transformation pipelines can be effectively written without access to real data by using small, synthetic `pandas` DataFrames to verify logic and edge cases.
- `[KB:DirectScriptImports]`: When running a Python script from a subdirectory that imports from a sibling `src` directory, ensure the `src` directory is added to `sys.path` at the top of the script to avoid `ModuleNotFoundError`.

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point**: Test coverage has been improved, data contracts are documented, and the CLIs have been consolidated.
- **Next Immediate Task**: Proceed with the next development cycle, such as further test enhancements or new feature work.
- **Known Issues**: None.
