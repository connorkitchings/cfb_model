# Dev Session Log — 2025-12-04

**Focus:** Refresh scores with weather fix, threshold compare, and lock experiment metrics.

## Summary
- Re-ran 2024 predictions/scoring with weather propagation fix: spread 226-207-8 (52.2% hit, ROI ≈ -0.36%), total 112-79-4 (58.6% hit, ROI ≈ +11.95%).
- Re-ran 2025 W2–W14 at live thresholds (5.0/7.5): spread 237-236-11 (50.1% hit, ROI ≈ -4.34%), total 95-90-0 (51.4% hit, ROI ≈ -1.97%). Week 15 generated but unscored.
- Tried higher thresholds (7/8) for comparison; reverted to 5.0/7.5 for live due to worse 2025 hit rates.
- Updated experiments index with refreshed metrics/ROIs and paths to scored outputs; kept high-threshold scored files for reference.

## Commands
```bash
# 2024 regen & score (weeks 2-16)
for w in $(seq 2 16); do ... generate_weekly_bets.py ... score_weekly_bets.py --year 2024 --week $w; done

# 2025 regen & score at thresholds 5.0/7.5 (weeks 2-15; week 15 unscored)
for w in $(seq 2 15); do ... generate_weekly_bets.py ... score_weekly_bets.py --year 2025 --week $w; done

# ROI/summary extraction
uv run python - <<'PY'
# load scored files, compute hit/ROI for spread/total (2024, 2025)
PY

# Health checks
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest -q  # passing after excluding scripts/archive
```

## Notes
- Weather data present and propagating; no missing-weather warnings after fix.
- Prediction still reads legacy `team_week_adj` cache; adjustment-iteration alignment not changed this session.
- Week 15 remains unscored (games pending).
