branch: [no-git-changes]
task: [IMPL-ingest-refactor] - Modularize, refactor, and document cfbd data ingestion scripts; rewrite plays ingestion; create unified CLI
---

## Wins

- Migrated all ingestion scripts into `src/cfb_model/data/ingestion/` as modular classes with a
  shared `BaseIngester` for FBS/year-specific ingestion ([PRD-feat:A])
- Rewrote and fixed the broken plays ingestion script as `PlaysIngester`, ensuring robust,
  maintainable logic ([LOG:2025-08-03_02])
- Developed a unified CLI (`scripts/ingest_cli.py`) to run any ingestion module with consistent
  arguments
- Updated documentation: `docs/cfbd/data_ingestion.md`, `docs/supabase/data_ingestion_status.md`
  to reflect new structure and usage
- Fixed lint warnings and improved code clarity (e.g., ambiguous variable names)

## Blockers

- No unresolved blockers; all planned ingestion refactors and rewrites completed

## Learnings/Patterns

- Centralizing ingestion logic in a base class improves maintainability and reduces duplication
- Unified CLI simplifies testing and usage for future ingestion tasks
- Documentation and code should be updated in tandem to avoid confusion ([PRD-feat:A])

## Artifacts & Links

- Ingestion Modules: `src/cfb_model/data/ingestion/`
- Unified CLI: `scripts/ingest_cli.py`
- Data Ingestion Guide: [docs/cfbd/data_ingestion.md]
- Ingestion Status: [docs/supabase/data_ingestion_status.md]
- Plan: [LOG:2025-08-03]

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: All ingestion modules refactored, modularized, and documented; plays ingestion
  logic rewritten and tested
- Immediate Next Task: Test ingestion modules via CLI, then deprecate legacy scripts in
  `/scripts/ingest_*.py`
- Next Steps: Begin modeling pipeline development using modular ingestion outputs
