## Session Focus

- Final preparations for modeling work.
- Validate existing data aggregations.
- Incorporate useful logic from legacy notebooks (`API_Functions.ipynb`, `CFB_Functions.ipynb`).
- Add a new validation step by ingesting official game stats and comparing them to play-by-play aggregations.

## Accomplishments

- **[IMPL-task:11a]** - Integrated hardcoded data fixes from `API_Functions.ipynb` into the `byplay.py` aggregation script to improve data quality.
- **[IMPL-task:11b]** - Created a new analysis utility module at `src/cfb_model/utils/visualizations.py` by porting graphing functions from `CFB_Functions.ipynb`.
- **[IMPL-task:19a]** - Created a new `GameStatsIngester` to fetch official game-level box scores for data validation.

## Blockers & Learnings

- **Blocker:** The new `GameStatsIngester` is unable to fetch data from the `get_advanced_box_score` API endpoint. We encountered a series of `TypeError` and `AttributeError` exceptions, suggesting a subtle issue with the `cfbd-python` library's method signature that we could not resolve during the session.
- **Learning:** The directory partitioning logic in `persist.py` had a bug where it created invalid directory names for teams (e.g., `('Team Name',)`). This was identified and fixed.
- **Learning:** The best practice of saving the raw API response before transforming it was reinforced. This decoupling makes debugging transformation logic much more efficient.

## Next Steps

- **Immediate Next Task:** Resolve the `GameStatsIngester` issue. The primary goal is to successfully download and save the raw advanced box score data. This is a prerequisite for the new data validation process.
