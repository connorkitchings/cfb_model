branch: main
task: [IMPL-task:plays_ingestion_fix] - Resolve plays ingestion failures and validate data integrity.
---

## Wins

- Successfully debugged and fixed the root cause of plays ingestion failures by parameterizing the
  `drives` and `plays` ingestion scripts to accept command-line arguments (`--year`,
  `--season_type`).
- Re-ingested drives and plays for 2015, resolving the foreign key constraint errors and confirming
  the fix.
- Completed a comprehensive data integrity validation on all ingested data, confirming no orphaned
  records or duplicate primary keys in the `games`, `drives`, `plays`, or `betting_lines` tables.
  The existing data is clean and has full referential integrity.

## Blockers

- The CFBD API monthly call quota was exceeded during the 2016 plays ingestion. Further data
  ingestion for years 2016-2021 is blocked until the quota resets.

## Artifacts & Links

- Learnings: Ingestion scripts must be parameterized via `argparse` to ensure they can be run
  flexibly for different years and season types without requiring code changes.

- Code Health: See [QG:PreCommit] checklist

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: Completed data integrity validation for all ingested data. All core tables are
  verified as clean. Ingestion is paused due to API rate limits.
- Next Immediate Task: While waiting for the API quota to reset, the next task is to address the
  minor field mapping issues in the Rosters and Coaches ingestion scripts.
- Known Issues: CFBD API quota is a recurring blocker for large-scale data ingestion.
- Next Session Context: Resume by investigating the rosters/coaches ingestion scripts or, if the
  API quota has reset, continue with the 2016 plays ingestion.
