branch: [no-git-changes]
task: [IMPL-ingest-test] - Test and validate modular ingestion scripts; prep for 10-year data collection
---

## Wins

- Successfully tested all modular ingestion scripts (teams, venues, games, drives, betting_lines,
  plays) via unified CLI ([PRD-feat:A])
- Fixed schema mapping in DrivesIngester to match actual DB structure (removed 'elapsed', mapped
  time components)
- Confirmed readiness for full-scale data collection for seasons 2015–2024

## Blockers

- RostersIngester and CoachesIngester: No data ingested due to missing/mismatched fields ('team_id'
  and 'team' attributes not present on returned objects)

## Learnings/Patterns

- Schema mismatches (API vs. DB) require careful review of both code and documentation ([KB:SchemaMapping])
- Modular CLI enables rapid, repeatable testing and will streamline future ingestion ([PRD-feat:A])

## Artifacts & Links

- Ingestion Modules: `src/cfb_model/data/ingestion/`
- Unified CLI: `scripts/ingest_cli.py`
- Data Ingestion Guide: [docs/cfbd/data_ingestion.md]
- Ingestion Status: [docs/supabase/data_ingestion_status.md]
- Plan: [LOG:2025-08-03]

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: All ingestion modules tested; core scripts operational; schema issues resolved for
- drives
- Immediate Next Task: Collect 10 years (2015–2024) of modeling data using validated ingestion
  scripts
- Known Issues: Rosters/Coaches ingestion field mapping needs minor fix, but is non-blocking for
  core modeling pipeline
- Next Session Context: Begin large-scale data ingestion and validate data integrity across all
  tables
