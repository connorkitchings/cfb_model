branch: [no-git-changes]
task: [IMPL-ingest-scripts] - Implement, test, and document FBS/year-specific data ingestion scripts for all major cfbd entities
---

## Wins

- Implemented and tested ingestion scripts for drives, betting_lines, rosters, and coaches tables
  with FBS/year-specific filtering
- Fixed schema alignment and datetime serialization issues across scripts
- Updated documentation to reflect ingestion status and script results

## Blockers

- Plays ingestion script (`ingest_plays.py`) has persistent syntax and logic errors; needs a
  complete rewrite for robust FBS/year-specific ingestion

## Artifacts & Links

- Ingestion Scripts: `scripts/ingest_drives.py`, `scripts/ingest_betting_lines.py`,
  `scripts/ingest_rosters.py`, `scripts/ingest_coaches.py`
- Status Tracking: [docs/supabase/data_ingestion_status.md]
- Data Ingestion Guide: [docs/cfbd/data_ingestion.md]
- Schema Reference: [docs/supabase/schema_and_syntax.md]
- Plan: [LOG:2025-08-03]

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: All ingestion scripts except plays are implemented, tested, and documented for
  FBS/year-specific data
- Next Immediate Task: Rewrite and test the plays ingestion script for FBS/year-specific data
- Known Issues: Plays script is nonfunctional due to syntax and logic errors
- Next Session Context: Resume with plays ingestion script rewrite, then run full ingestion for all
  entities if needed
