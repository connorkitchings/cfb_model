**Session Accomplishments:**

* **Task Completed:** `IMPL-001` - Redo data ingestion and aggregation to save raw data in CSVs with
   a simplified folder structure.
* **Key Outcomes:**
  * Successfully refactored the `LocalStorage` class to handle both CSV and Parquet formats, and to
   implement a new simplified folder structure (e.g., `data/raw/entity/year/week/game_id/`).
  * Updated all ingester classes (`TeamsIngester`, `VenuesIngester`, `GamesIngester`,
   `BettingLinesIngester`, `CoachesIngester`, `RostersIngester`, `PlaysIngester`) to utilize the new
   `LocalStorage` and its simplified partitioning scheme.
  * Successfully ingested all raw data for years 2014-2024 (excluding 2020) into the new CSV format
   with the desired folder structure.
  * Confirmed that the `PlaysIngester` now correctly partitions data by year, week, and game ID.

**Blockers and Learnings:**

* **Blockers Encountered:**
  * Initial issues with `python` command not found, resolved by using `python3` and setting `PYTHONPATH`.
  * Misunderstanding of `LocalStorage.read_index` behavior with the new folder structure, leading to
   initial debug messages showing 0 records read back. This was resolved by correctly passing
   filters to `read_index` and ensuring the `_entity_partition_dir` method correctly constructs paths.
  * Issue with `RostersIngester` attempting to dynamically add `team_id` to a `pydantic` model,
   resolved by converting the object to a dictionary before adding the `team_id`.
  * Oversight in manually moving 2024 plays data, leading to incorrect folder structure initially.
   Resolved by deleting the old directory and re-running the ingester.
* **New Learnings/Patterns:**
  * The importance of thorough testing and verification after significant refactoring, especially
   concerning file paths and data serialization.
  * Best practices for handling `pydantic` models when adding custom attributes (convert to
   dictionary first).
  * The utility of `PYTHONPATH` for managing module imports in complex project structures.

**Next Steps:**

* **Immediate Next Task:** Update the `pyproject.toml` to reflect the new dependencies (pandas,
   pyarrow). Review and update `README.md`, `docs/index.md`, `mkdocs.yml`, `docs/decisions/README.
   md`, `docs/project_org/project_charter.md`, and `docs/project_org/kb_overview.md` to
   reflect the changes in data ingestion and storage.
