branch: main
task: [DEBUG-task:MLOPS-INFRASTRUCTURE] - Resolve MLflow artifact logging issues and standardize project directory structure
---

## Wins

- ✅ **MLflow Artifact Logging Issue - COMPLETELY RESOLVED**: Identified and fixed inconsistent tracking URI configuration across scripts
- ✅ **Standardized MLflow URIs**: Updated all scripts to use `file:./artifacts/mlruns` consistently
- ✅ **Fixed Experiment Metadata**: Updated meta.yaml files to point to correct artifact locations
- ✅ **Cleaned Project Structure**: Removed erroneous `mlruns` and `multirun` directories from project root
- ✅ **Configured Hydra Sweeps**: Set `HYDRA_SWEEP_DIR` environment variable to direct sweeps to `artifacts/outputs/`
- ✅ **Verified Functionality**: MLflow UI running successfully, hyperparameter optimization working correctly

## Blockers

- None - all issues resolved successfully

## Artifacts & Links

- Code Health: All MLflow scripts now use consistent `file:./artifacts/mlruns` URI
- Learnings: [KB:MLflowTrackingURI], [KB:HydraSweepDirectory]
- Documentation: Updated decision log with infrastructure fixes

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: MLflow infrastructure fully functional and properly organized
- Next Immediate Task: Begin Sprint 5 development (walk-forward validation, performance dashboard)
- Known Issues: None - project infrastructure is solid
- Next Session Context: Ready to proceed with advanced modeling and monitoring featuresdate: 2025-10-30
