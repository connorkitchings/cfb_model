branch: main
task: [IMPL-task:CLEANUP-PRIORITY-1] - Code quality cleanup, documentation updates, and performance summary
---

## Wins

- ✅ **Fixed all code formatting issues**: 7 files reformatted using ruff
- ✅ **Fixed all linting errors**: Resolved 3 N806/N803 naming violations in `model_improvement_experiments.py` and `train_model.py`
- ✅ **Fixed failing test**: Updated `test_imports.py` to reference correct module path after ridge_baseline refactoring
- ✅ **All health checks passing**: Format, lint, tests (13/13), and docs all pass cleanly
- ✅ **Documented RandomForest decision**: Added comprehensive entry to `docs/decisions/decision_log.md` for 2025-09-30
- ✅ **Updated modeling baseline docs**: Reflected current hybrid architecture (Ridge + RandomForest) with performance metrics
- ✅ **Created comprehensive performance summary**: Detailed 2024 season analysis at `reports/2024/PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY.md`

## Blockers

- None encountered. All cleanup tasks completed successfully.

## Artifacts & Links

- **Decision Log**: `docs/decisions/decision_log.md` - Added 2025-09-30 entry for RandomForest totals model
- **Modeling Baseline**: `docs/project_org/modeling_baseline.md` - Updated with current architecture and performance
- **Performance Summary**: `reports/2024/PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive 335-line analysis including:
  - Executive summary with key metrics (54.6% combined hit rate)
  - Model architecture details (Ridge spreads, RandomForest totals)
  - Weekly performance breakdown
  - Feature engineering highlights
  - Calibration methodology
  - Profitability analysis (4.53% ROI, +18.9 units)
  - Variance analysis and recommendations
  - Complete improvement timeline
  - Next steps prioritization

- **Code Quality Fixes**:
  - `scripts/model_improvement_experiments.py` - Fixed N806 errors by renaming `X` → `x_train`
  - `src/cfb_model/models/train_model.py` - Fixed N803 error by renaming `X` → `x_data`
  - `tests/test_imports.py` - Updated module path from `ridge_baseline.train` → `train_model`

## Handoff

- **Stopping Point**: All Priority 1 tasks completed. Codebase is clean, stable, and fully documented. Health checks all pass (36 files formatted, 0 lint errors, 13/13 tests pass, docs build successfully).

- **Next Immediate Task**: Priority 2 focus options:
  1. **Variance Reduction** - Implement ensemble approach or confidence-based filtering to reduce week-to-week volatility (42.9%-75.0% spread range)
  2. **Hyperparameter Optimization** - Grid search for RandomForest (current params not tuned) to potentially gain 1-2pp performance
  3. **Rolling Performance Monitoring** - Set up automated tracking and circuit breakers for live operation

- **Known Issues**: None. All identified issues from session logs resolved.

- **Next Session Context**:
  - Project has achieved **first profitable configuration** (54.6% hit rate, +2.2pp above breakeven)
  - Foundation is solid: no data leakage, correct betting logic, calibrated thresholds, optimized pipeline
  - Documentation is comprehensive and current
  - Ready for model enhancement phase (Priority 2-3 work)
  - Consider starting with hyperparameter optimization for quick wins before variance reduction
