task: [IMPL-task:MODEL-IMPROVEMENT-INITIAL] - Switched to RandomForest for totals, retrained, and evaluated model performance.
---

## Wins

- Successfully retrained the spread model (Ridge) and the new total model (RandomForestRegressor).
- Ran the full 2024 season with the new models, achieving an overall hit rate of 54.7% for spreads and 54.5% for totals.
- Conducted a threshold sweep for both spread and total bets, confirming that the model's edge is a valuable indicator of bet success.

## Blockers

- `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `shap` library, which was resolved by installing it.
- `TypeError` in the SHAP explainer for the RandomForestRegressor, which was resolved by explicitly casting the input data to `float64`.
- Several `ModuleNotFoundError` issues when running scripts from the command line, which were resolved by running the scripts as modules from the correct directory or by adding the `src` directory to the `PYTHONPATH`.

## Artifacts & Links

- Learnings: `[KB:PYTHONPATH-ISSUES]` - When running scripts from the command line that are part of a package, it's crucial to ensure that the package's root directory is in the `PYTHONPATH`. This can be done by running the script as a module (`-m`), setting the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable, or by adding the path to `sys.path` within the script itself.
- Learnings: `[KB:SHAP-DATATYPE-SENSITIVITY]` - The `shap` library can be sensitive to data types, even if a dataframe's `info()` output appears correct. Explicitly casting data to the expected type (e.g., `float64`) can resolve unexpected `TypeError` exceptions.

## Handoff

- Stopping Point: The initial model improvement task is complete. The models have been updated, and their performance has been evaluated.
- Next Immediate Task: Focus on further model improvements, such as more advanced feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, or exploring other model architectures.
- Known Issues: Two minor `N806` linting errors remain in `scripts/model_improvement_experiments.py`.
- Next Session Context: The project is in a good state with profitable models. The next session should focus on strategies to further improve the models' performance.
