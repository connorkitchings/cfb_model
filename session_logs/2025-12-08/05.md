# Dev Log: Threshold Alignment & Inference Hygiene

**Date**: 2025-12-08  
**Session**: 05

## 1. Summarize Session Accomplishments

- **Task Completed**: Align weekly bets pipeline with updated thresholds and clean inference inputs.
- **Key Outcomes**:
  - Updated `conf/weekly_bets/v2_champion.yaml` to use spread edge 0.0 (with 8.0 high-confidence noted) and totals edge 1.5; synced docs (`docs/ops/weekly_pipeline.md`, `docs/modeling/betting_policy.md`).
  - Added feature-magnitude logging and stripped non-informative ID/metadata columns before model input in `scripts/pipeline/generate_weekly_bets.py`.
  - Regenerated and scored bets for all 2024 weeks (1–16) and 2025 weeks (2–16); only missing lines/scores are Liberty @ App State (2024 Wk5). Week 2025-16 not scored due to no final scores yet.
  - Documented follow-up to consider feature standardization/normalization in `docs/modeling/features.md`.

## 2. Identify Blockers and Learnings

- **Blockers Encountered**: None blocking; sklearn matmul runtime warnings persist on weeks 14 (2024/2025) but outputs are finite.
- **New Learnings/Patterns**: Non-informative identifiers (IDs, venue, Elo) should be excluded from model inputs; magnitude logging is useful to confirm only feature-scale values reach the model.

## 3. Define Next Steps

- **Immediate Next Task**: Optionally suppress or address the runtime warnings (e.g., drop constant season/year fields or plan a standardization/normalization experiment).
- **Data Note**: Score 2025 Wk16 once game results are available.

## 4. Final Health Check

- Not run this session (lint/tests/mkdocs not executed).
